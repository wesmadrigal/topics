Cet article s'int\u00e9resse \u00e0 la definition du genre reggae et propose une analyse de trois tensions principales qui sont essentielles en son sein et qui concernent la d\u00e9finition du reggae, la distinction entre le reggae roots et le reggae dancehall, et l'implantation du reggae en-dehors de son lieu d'origine. Ces tensions t\u00e9moignent de la construction subjective qui est \u00e0 l'oeuvre dans la d\u00e9finition de tout style musical, dont les fronti\u00e8res symboliques sont \u00e9tablies de mani\u00e8re variable et d\u00e9pendante du contexte social et culturel.\n      </p>", "The economic contribution of the cultural or entertainment industries to tourism is largely undervalued in Caribbean development policy. This article confronts this lacuna and gives some insight into the costs and benefits of festival tourism. The article argues that festival tourism is an efficacious strategy given that the Caribbean enjoys a healthy reputation in live entertainment, the performance arts and the music industry. The case of Jamaica and Reggae Sunsplash is used to illustrate how festivals make a healthy return on investment in terms of arrivals, occupancy rates, visitor expenditures, international media exposure and destination loyalty from cultural tourists. The socio-economic and political challenges of festival management are also discussed. The article calls for the \"culturalization\" of tourism and recommends festival tourism as an effective means to enhance competitiveness in Caribbean tourism as well as bolster cultural identity and confidence. La contribution \u00e9conomique des industries culturelle et de loisir est tr\u00e8s sous-\u00e9valu\u00e9e dans la politique de d\u00e9veloppement dans la Cara\u00efbe. Le pr\u00e9sent article examine cette lacune et donne quelques informations sur le tourisme de festival. En outre, l'article postule que ce genre de tourisme serait une strat\u00e9gie tr\u00e8s efficace \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la r\u00e9putation que poss\u00e8de la r\u00e9gion en mati\u00e8re de spectacles, les arts et de l'industrie de la musique. La cas de la Jama\u00efque et de Reggae Sunsplash sert \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer la nature lucrative des festivals en ce qui concerne les arriv\u00e9es, la location des chambres, les d\u00e9penses des visiteurs, la publicit\u00e9 faite par les m\u00e9dias et la fid\u00e9lit\u00e9 a la destination des touristes culturels. Les d\u00e9fis socio-\u00e9conomiques et politiques que pr\u00e9sentent la gestion des festivals sont \u00e9galement discut\u00e9s. L'article appelle \u00e0 la \u00ab culturalisation \u00bb du tourisme et sugg\u00e8re que le tourisme de festivals soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un moyen efficace pour accro\u00eetre la comp\u00e9titivit\u00e9 du tourisme de la Cara\u00efbe et pousser l'identit\u00e9 et la fiert\u00e9 culturelles. La aportaci\u00f3n de las industrias culturales o de entretenimiento al turismo se desestima, por la mayor parte, en la pol\u00edtica del desarrollo del Caribe. Este art\u00edculo se enfrenta con esta laguna y aclara los costos y beneficios del turismo de los festivales. El art\u00edculo afirma que el turismo de los festivales es una estrategia eficaz, teniendo en cuenta el hecho de que el Caribe goza de una fama renombrada respecto al entretenimiento en vivo, las artes de actuaci\u00f3n y la industria de m\u00fasicos. El caso de Jamaica y Reggae Sunsplash se utiliza para demostrar c\u00f3mo los festivales son lucrativos para los inversionistas respecto a las llegadas, los niveles de hospedaje, los gastos de las visitas, la publicidad en los medios internacionales y la lealtad de los turistas culturales al destino. Tambi\u00e9n se tratan los retos socio-econ\u00f3micos y pol\u00edticos de manejar los festivales. El art\u00edculo recomienda la \"culturalizaci\u00f3n\" del turismo y recomienda el turismo de los festivales como un modo eficaz de aumentar la competitividad en el turismo caribe\u00f1o, as\u00ed como de reforzar la identidad cultural y la confianza.\n      </p>", "The globalisation of reggae continues to engender a wide range of highly poignant re-inscriptions and re-interpretations of reggae's sound and of Rastafarian thought. One of the most compelling of these has been the negotiation of Rastafarian and Christian ideologies within the context of Protestant reggae bands and artists. The application of Rastafarian thought, dress and language to the evangelical concerns of Protestants - at times paradoxical, at others ingenious - signals an important moment of inter-religious contact that opens a window onto the complexities and multiple meanings that attach to music and to religious systems as they travel between the local and the global. This essay considers music by Christafari (United States), Sherwin Gardner (Trinidad and Tobago), and Stitchie (Jamaica), and considers questions related to the parallel globalisation of reggae and Rastafari. It does this by interrogating the extent to which authenticity, positionality, and religious context inform the use of and interpretation of Rastafari symbols within gospel reggae. In so doing, I introduce a concept that I call the negotiation of proximity, and offer some reflections on the ways that the Rastafari elements within gospel reggae might be understood in new, global (and newly localised) contexts.\n      </p>", "This paper explores the representation of the postcolonial Jamaican nation state in the genre of \"roots and culture\" reggae. It argues that this particular genre of reggae, noted primarily for its heavy emphasis on social commentary, contests the Jamaican political elite constructions of nation, nationalism, and nationality. Unlike elite representations which elide the problematic issues of race, class, and subordinated historical narratives, reggae songs reder the nation state as a \"state of emergency\" which is grounded in the imperatives of maintaining inherited colonial hierarchies. The millenarian worldview of Rastafari and the identity politics of Pan-Africanism provide ideological crucibles for reggae's oppositional critique of the Jamaican nation state. This critique, articulated as prophetic rhetoric, constitutes an alternative political and historical discourse that is legitimised by the dynamics of popular culture. Esta ponencia explora la representaci\u00f3n del estado naci\u00f3n postcolonial en el g\u00e9nero de reggae \"ra\u00edces y cultura\". Argumenta que este g\u00e9nero particular de reggae, que se destaca principalmente por su gran \u00e9nfasis sobre los comentarios sociales, disputa las construcciones \u00e9lites pol\u00edticas de la naci\u00f3n, nacionalismo y nacionalidad. Distinto a las representaciones \u00e9lites que eluden los asuntos problem\u00e1ticos de raza, clase y narrativas hist\u00f3ricas subordinadas, las canciones de reggae interpretan el estado naci\u00f3n como \"estado de emergencia\" con sus cimientes en los imperativos de mantener las jerarqu\u00edas coloniales heredadas. El punto de vista mundial milenario de los Rastafarianos y las pol\u00edticas de identidad del Panafricanismo, provee crisoles ideol\u00f3gicos para la cr\u00edtica, opuesta del reggae del estado naci\u00f3n Jamaicano. Esta cr\u00edtica, articulada como ret\u00f3rica prof\u00e9tica, constituye una alternativa pol\u00edtica y discurso hist\u00f3rico que se hace leg\u00edtimo por la din\u00e1mica de la cultura popular. Le pr\u00e9sent article explore la repr\u00e9sentation de l'\u00e9tat jam\u00efcain postcolonial dans le type de reggae appell\u00e9 'roots and culture'. Il soutient que ce type de reggae en particulier qui se distingue par l'accent qu'il met sur le commentaire social, s'oppose aux constructions de l'\u00e9lite politique jama\u00efcain relatives \u00e0 la nation, au nation, au nationalisme et \u00e0 la nationalit\u00e9. A la diff\u00e9rence des repr\u00e9sentations qui \u00e9lident les questions difficiles de race, de classe et les narrataions historiques subordonn\u00e9es, le reggae pr\u00e9sente l'\u00e9tat comme un '\u00e9tat '\u00e9tat d'urgence' qui veut \u00e0 tout prix maintenir les hi\u00e9rarchies coloniales h\u00e9rit\u00e9es. La vision des Rastas du prochain mill\u00e9naire et les politiques d'identit\u00e9 du panafricanisme constituent des \u00e9preuves id\u00e9ologiques pour les critiques faites par le reggae de la nation jam\u00efcaine. Cette satire qui se pr\u00e9sente sous la forme du rh\u00e9torique proph\u00e9tique, constitue un autre discours politique et historique l\u00e9gitim\u00e9 par la dynamique de la culture populaire.\n      </p>", "This is an analysis of reggae in the Euro-American market, and the ways in which conscious commodification of the music has undermined its aesthetic and ideological substance. This erosive process is primarily illustrated through case studies of Bob Marley, Aswad and Steel Pulse, all prominent reggae artistes who have been associated with major record companies from the 1970s to the 1990s. Their encounters with Western economic hegemony and the inevitably concomitant creative compromises are identified as precedent setting. The textual homogeneity which major labels imposed in earlier reggae history has predetermined their approach to re/presentation in the digital Dancehall era. Moreover, the very digital character of modern reggae-oreinted music has rigidified many creative textual boundaries and facilitated mass replication of a formerly distinctive cultural aesthetic in the service of capitalism. Este es un an\u00e1lisis de reggae en el mercado Euroamericano y el modo como la comercializaci\u00f3n consciente de la m\u00fasica ha socavado su esencia est\u00e9tica e idol\u00f3gica. Este proceso erosivo es primariamente ilustrado mediante estudios de caso referentes a Bob Marley, Aswad y Steel Pulse, todos prominentes int\u00e9rpretes del reggae y que han sido asociados con las m\u00e1s importanes compa\u00f1\u00edas de grabaci\u00f3n desde la d\u00e9cada de los 70 a la d\u00e9cada de los 90. Su encuentro con la hegemon\u00eda econ\u00f3mica del Oeste, y los concomitantes compromisos creativos son inevitablemente identificados como entorno precedente. La homogeneidad textual impuesta por los grupos m\u00e1s importanes en la temprana historia del reggae, ha predeterminado su enfoque a la re/presentaci\u00f3n de la era de Dancehall (sal\u00f3n de baile). Por otra parte, el mismo car\u00e1cter digital de la m\u00fasica orientada al reggae, ha llevado a la rigidez de muchos linderos textuales creativos y ha facilitado la reproducci\u00f3n en masa de una est\u00e9tica cultural distintiva de antes, en beneficio del capitalismo. Le pr\u00e9sent article propose une \u00e9tude du reggae sur le march\u00e9 euro-am\u00e9ricain et analyse la fa\u00e7on dont la modification consciente de la musique a rang\u00e9 ses aspects esth\u00e9tiques et id\u00e9ologiques essentiels. Ce ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne d'\u00e9rosion s'illustre principalement par des \u00e9tudes de cas sur Bob Marley, Aswad et Steel Pulse, tous artistes de reggae pro\u00e9minants ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 associ\u00e9s aux principales compagnies d'enregistrement des ann\u00e9es 60 aux ann\u00e9es 90. Leur rencontre avec l'h\u00e9g\u00e9monie \u00e9conomique occidentale et les in\u00e9vitables compromis cr\u00e9atreurs concomitantes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnues comme \u00e9tant des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents. L'homog\u00e9n\u00e9it\u00e9 textuelle impos\u00e9e par les principales compagnies au d\u00e9but de l'histoire musicale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 leur approche dans la (re)pr\u00e9sentation de l'\u00e9poque digitale du Dancehall. De plus, le caract\u00e8re tr\u00e8s digital de la musique moderne orient\u00e9e vers le reggae a rendu rigide les fronti\u00e8res textuelles cr\u00e9atrices et a favoris\u00e9 la reproduction en masse d'une forme culturelle esth\u00e9tique, d\u00e9sormais au service du capitalisme.\n      </p>", "This article examines Reggae as it has developed in the Spanish circum-Caribbean, especially in Panama and Costa Rica. It looks at how the imitation of the original music and lyrics leads to transpositions and repositioning as the cultural messages adjust and accommodate to the receiving society. It argues that what emerges is a shift towards Eurocentric aesthetic images and a reduction in the tone of violence and in confrontational stances towards traditional authority images. Gender attitudes are examined and it is concluded that while privileging of the male and subordination of the female dominate, there is a greater openness to concepts of family. The study corroborates notions of the transculturation process, by which accommodations to values and sensibilities of the host society create a transformation of the originating cultural models. Este art\u00edculo examina el Reggae del modo como se ha desarrollado en el entorno Caribe hisp\u00e1nico, especialmente en Panam\u00e1 y Costa Rica.

Las actitudes de g\u00e9nero son examinadas y se concluye que mientras que lo que predomina es el privilegio del hombre y la subordinaci\u00f3n de la mujer, existe una mayor apertura a los conceptos de la familia. El estudio corrobora las nociones del proceso transcultural, mediante los cuales las adaptaciones a los valores y sensibilidades de la sociedas anfitriona provoca una transformaci\u00f3n de los modelos culturales que lo originaran.

Focusing on the involvement of Chinese Jamaicans in the development of reggae, the essay advances the argument that the social and historical factors that condition Chinese Jamaican migration also determine the nature of their impact on reggae. The significant numbers of Chinese Jamaicans who have served as producers, sound system owners, band managers, and distributors reflect the roles that Chinese Jamaicans play as merchants and middlemen in Jamaican society as well the high degree of transnational mobility and effective familial networks they have developed. A series of videotaped interviews with the Chinese Jamaican family that started and currently runs VP Records, a major international distributor of reggae music, serves as the case study from which the main conclusions of the essay are extrapolated. El ensayo investiga los efectos del movimiento di\u00e1sporo en la est\u00e9tica, pol\u00edtica y econom\u00eda del reggae. Enfoc\u00e1ndose en la participaci\u00f3n de chinos-jamaiquinos en el desarrollo del reggae, el ensayo propone el argumento de que los factores sociales e hist\u00f3ricos que condicionan la migraci\u00f3n chino-jamaiquina, tambi\u00e9n determinan la naturaleza de su impacto en el reggae. El n\u00famero significativo de chino-jamaiquinos que han servido como productores, due\u00f1os de sistemas de sonidos, directores de bandas y distribuidores, refleja los papeles que los chino-jamaiquinos desempe\u00f1an como comerciantes e intermediarios en la sociedad jamaiquina, as\u00ed como el alto nivel de movilidad transnacional y de organizaciones familiares efectivas que ellos han desarrollado. Una serie de entrevistas en cintas de video con la familia chino-jamaiquina que cre\u00f3 y actualmente dirige VP Records, un distribuidor mayor internacional de m\u00fasica reggae, sirve como el caso de estudio del cual se extrapolan las conclusiones de este ensayo.

The disseminatory power of \"micro media\" (cheap cassettes, VCDs) facilitates the global movement of both musical sounds and political ideas. I argue, using examples of Uyghur reggae and Uyghur belly dancing, that these sounds and meanings are radically adapted and re-signified in the construction of Uyghur identity and cultural politics, in a complex interplay between the global, national and local, and between tradition and modernity. I discuss the gendered expression of Uyghur nationalism in popular song through the iconic figure of the weeping mother, demonstrating the ability of expressive culture (here music) to reveal underlying or underpinning political trends.\n      </p>", "Based upon an analysis of patterns of variation in morphology, pigmentation, habitat, and Mysmenopsis kleptoparasites, two new species of Ischnothele from Jamaica (I. reggae and I. xera) are described.

It was an innovation that changed radically the character of human society. Here, we provide an approach to language evolution based on evolutionary game theory. We explore the ways in which protolanguages can evolve in a nonlinguistic society and how specific signals can become associated with specific objects. We assume that early in the evolution of language, errors in signaling and perception would be common. We model the probability of misunderstanding a signal and show that this limits the number of objects that can be described by a protolanguage. This \"error limit\" is not overcome by employing more sounds but by combining a small set of more easily distinguishable sounds into words. The process of \"word formation\" enables a language to encode an essentially unlimited number of objects. Next, we analyze how words can be combined into sentences and specify the conditions for the evolution of very simple grammatical rules. We argue that grammar originated as a simplified rule system that evolved by natural selection to reduce mistakes in communication. Our theory provides a systematic approach for thinking about the origin and evolution of human language.\n      </p>", "Cancer is the consequence of an unwanted evolutionary process. Cells receive mutations that alter their phenotype. Especially dangerous are those mutations that increase the net reproductive rate of cells, thereby leading to neoplasia and later to cancer. The standard models of evolutionary dynamics consider well mixed populations of individuals in symmetric positions. Here we introduce a spatially explicit, asymmetric stochastic process that captures the essential architecture of evolutionary dynamics operating within tissues of multicellular organisms. The \"linear process\" has the property of canceling out selective differences among cells yet retaining the protective function of apoptosis. This design can slow down the rate of somatic evolution dramatically and therefore delay the onset of cancer.\n      </p>", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a high GC Gram-positive member of the actinobacteria. The mycobacterial cell wall is composed of a complex assortment of lipids and is the interface between the bacterium and its environment. The biosynthesis of fatty acids plays an essential role in the formation of cell wall components, in particular mycolic acids, which have been targeted by many of the drugs used to treat M. tuberculosis infection. M. tuberculosis has \u2248250 genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, a much higher proportion than in any other organism. In silico methods have been used to compare the genome of M. tuberculosis CDC1551 to a database of 58 complete bacterial genomes. The resulting alignments were scanned for genes specifically involved in fatty acid biosynthetic pathway I. Phylogenetic analysis of these alignments was used to investigate horizontal gene transfer, gene duplication, and adaptive evolution. It was found that of the eight gene families examined, five of the phylogenies reconstructed suggest that the actinobacteria have a closer relationship with the \u03b1-proteobacteria than expected. This is either due to either an ancient transfer of genes or deep paralogy and subsequent retention of the genes in unrelated lineages. Additionally, adaptive evolution and gene duplication have been an influence in the evolution of the pathway. This study provides a key insight into how M. tuberculosis has developed its unique fatty acid synthetic abilities.\n      </p>", "Gnathostome vertebrates have multiple members of the Dlx family of transcription factors that are expressed during the development of several tissues considered to be vertebrate synapomorphies, including the forebrain, cranial neural crest, placodes, and pharyngeal arches. The Dlx gene family thus presents an ideal system in which to examine the relationship between gene duplication and morphological innovation during vertebrate evolution. Toward this end, we have cloned Dlx genes from the lamprey Petromyzon marinus, an agnathan vertebrate that occupies a critical phylogenetic position between cephalochordates and gnathostomes. We have identified four Dlx genes in P. marinus, whose orthology with gnathostome Dlx genes provides a model for how this gene family evolved in the vertebrate lineage. Differential expression of these lamprey Dlx genes in the forebrain, cranial neural crest, pharyngeal arches, and sensory placodes of lamprey embryos provides insight into the developmental evolution of these structures as well as a model of regulatory evolution after Dlx gene duplication events.\n      </p>", "Fossil Foraminifera appear in the Early Cambrian, at about the same time as the first skeletonized metazoans. However, due to the inadequate preservation of early unilocular (single-chambered) foraminiferal tests and difficulties in their identification, the evolution of early foraminifers is poorly understood. By using molecular data from a wide range of extant naked and testate unilocular species, we demonstrate that a large radiation of nonfossilized unilocular Foraminifera preceded the diversification of multilocular lineages during the Carboniferous. Within this radiation, similar test morphologies and wall types developed several times independently. Our findings indicate that the early Foraminifera were an important component of Neoproterozoic protistan community, whose ecological complexity was probably much higher than has been generally accepted.\n      </p>", "The presence of genetic variation for learning ability in animals opens the way for experiments asking how and under what ecological circumstances improved learning ability should evolve. Here we report experimental evolution of learning ability in Drosophila melanogaster. We exposed experimental populations for 51 generations to conditions that we expected to favor associative learning with regard to oviposition substrate choice. Flies that learned to associate a chemical cue (quinine) with a particular substrate, and still avoided this substrate several hours after the cue had been removed, were expected to contribute more alleles to the next generation. From about generation 15 on, the experimental populations showed marked ability to avoid oviposition substrates that several hours earlier had contained the chemical cue. The improved response to conditioning was also expressed when the flies were faced with a choice of novel media. We demonstrate that these behavioral changes are caused by the evolution of both a higher learning rate and a better memory.\n      </p>", "The development of most phenotypic traits involves complex interactions between many underlying factors, both genetic and environmental. To study the evolution of such processes, a set of mathematical relationships is derived that describe how selection acts to change the distribution of genetic variation given arbitrarily complex developmental interactions and any distribution of genetic and environmental variation. The result is illustrated by using it to derive models for the evolution of dominance and for the evolutionary consequences of asymmetry in the distribution of genetic variation.\n      </p>", "Most studies of microsatellite evolution utilize long, highly mutable loci, which are unrepresentative of the majority of simple repeats in the human genome. Here we use an unbiased sample of 2,467 microsatellite loci derived from alignments of 5.1 Mb of genomic sequence from human and chimpanzee to investigate the mutation process of tandemly repetitive DNA. The results indicate that the process of microsatellite evolution is highly heterogeneous, exhibiting differences between loci of different lengths and motif sizes and between species. We find a highly significant tendency for human dinucleotide repeats to be longer than their orthologues in chimpanzees, whereas the opposite trend is observed in mononucleotide repeat arrays. Furthermore, the rate of divergence between orthologues is significantly higher at longer loci, which also show significantly greater mutability per repeat number. These observations have important consequences for understanding the molecular mechanisms of microsatellite mutation and for the development of improved measures of genetic distance.\n      </p>", "An improved understanding of the evolution of gene function at the molecular level may provide significant insights into the origin of biological novelty and adaptation. With the approach of ancestral protein reconstruction, we here address the question of how a dramatically enhanced ribonucleolytic activity and the related antiviral activity evolved in a recently duplicated ribonuclease (eosinophil-derived neurotoxin) gene of higher primates. We show that the mother gene of the duplicated genes had already possessed a weak antiviral activity before duplication. After duplication, substitutions at two interacting sites (Arg-64\u2192Ser and Thr-132\u2192Arg) resulted in a 13-fold enhancement of the ribonucleolytic activity of eosinophil-derived neurotoxin. These substitutions are also necessary for the potent antiviral activity, with contributions from additional amino acid changes at interacting sites. Our observation that a change in eosinophil-derived neurotoxin function occurs only when both interacting sites are altered indicates the importance of complementary substitutions in protein evolution. Thus, neutral substitutions are not simply \"noises\" in protein evolution, as many have thought. They may play constructive roles by setting the intramolecular microenvironment for further complementary advantageous substitutions, which can lead to improved or altered function. Overall, our study illustrates the power of the \"paleomolecular biochemistry\" approach in delineating the complex interplays of amino acid substitutions in evolution and in identifying the molecular basis of biological innovation.\n      </p>", "Regulation of physiological functions with approximate daily periodicity, or circadian rhythms, is a characteristic feature of eukaryotes. Until recently, cyanobacteria were the only prokaryotes reported to possess circadian rhythmicity. It is controlled by a cluster of three genes: kaiA, kaiB, and kaiC. Using sequence data of \u224870 complete prokaryotic genomes from the various public depositories, we show here that the kai genes and their homologs have quite a different evolutionary history and occur in Archaea and Proteobacteria as well. Among the three genes, kaiC is evolutionarily the oldest, and kaiA is the youngest and likely evolved only in cyanobacteria. Our data suggest that the prokaryotic circadian pacemakers have evolved in parallel with the geological history of the earth, and that natural selection, multiple lateral transfers, and gene duplications and losses have been the major factors shaping their evolution.\n      </p>", "We study fitness landscape in the space of protein sequences by relating sets of human pathogenic missense mutations in 32 proteins to amino acid substitutions that occurred in the course of evolution of these proteins. On average, \u224810% of deviations of a nonhuman protein from its human ortholog are compensated pathogenic deviations (CPDs), i.e., are caused by an amino acid substitution that, at this site, would be pathogenic to humans. Normal functioning of a CPD-containing protein must be caused by other, compensatory deviations of the nonhuman species from humans. Together, a CPD and the corresponding compensatory deviation form a Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility that can be visualized as the corner on a fitness ridge. Thus, proteins evolve along fitness ridges which contain only \u224810 steps between successive corners. The fraction of CPDs among all deviations of a protein from its human ortholog does not increase with the evolutionary distance between the proteins, indicating that substitutions that carry evolving proteins around these corners occur in rapid succession, driven by positive selection. Data on fitness of interspecies hybrids suggest that the compensatory change that makes a CPD fit usually occurs within the same protein. Data on protein structures and on cooccurrence of amino acids at different sites of multiple orthologous proteins often make it possible to provisionally identify the substitution that compensates a particular CPD.\n      </p>", "Using a previously undescribed approach, we develop an analytic model that predicts whether an asexual population accumulates advantageous or deleterious mutations over time and the rate at which either process occurs. The model considers a large number of linked identical loci, or nucleotide sites; assumes that the selection coefficient per site is much less than the mutation rate per genome; and includes back and compensating mutations. Using analysis and Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate the accuracy of our results over almost the entire range of population sizes. Two limiting cases of our results, when either deleterious or advantageous mutations can be neglected, correspond to the Fisher-Muller effect and Muller's ratchet, respectively. By comparing predictions of our model (no recombination) to those of simple single-locus models (strong recombination), we show that the accumulation of advantageous mutations is slowed by linkage over a broad, finite range of population size. This supports the view of Fisher and Muller, who argued in the 1930s that progressive evolution of organisms is slowed because loci at which beneficial mutations can occur are often linked together on the same chromosome. These results follow from our main finding, that distribution of sequences over the mutation number evolves as a traveling wave whose speed and width depend on population size and other parameters. The model explains a logarithmic dependence of steady-state fitness on the population size reported recently for an RNA virus.\n      </p>", "Filamentous fungi within the Fusarium graminearum species complex (Fg complex) are the primary etiological agents of Fusarium head blight (scab) of wheat and barley. Scab is an economically devastating plant disease that greatly limits grain yield and quality. In addition, scabby grain is often contaminated with trichothecene mycotoxins that act as virulence factors on some hosts, and pose a serious threat to animal health and food safety. Strain-specific differences in trichothecene metabolite profiles (chemotypes) are not well correlated with the Fg complex phylogeny based on genealogical concordance at six single-copy nuclear genes. To examine the basis for this discord between species and toxin evolution, a 19-kb region of the trichothecene gene cluster was sequenced in 39 strains chosen to represent the global genetic diversity of species in the Fg complex and four related species of Fusarium. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that polymorphism within these virulence-associated genes is transspecific and appears to have been maintained by balancing selection acting on chemotype differences that originated in the ancestor of this important group of plant pathogens. Chemotype-specific differences in selective constraint and evidence of adaptive evolution within trichothecene genes are also reported.\n      </p>", "The evolution of the Metazoa from protozoans is one of the major milestones in life's history. The genetic and developmental events involved in this evolutionary transition are unknown but may have involved the evolution of genes required for signaling and gene regulation in metazoans. The genome of animal ancestors may be reconstructed by identification of animal genes that are shared with related eukaryotes, particularly those that share a more recent ancestry and cell biology with animals. The choanoflagellates have long been suspected to be closer relatives of animals than are fungi, the closest outgroup of animals for which comparative genomic information is available. Phylogenetic analyses of choanoflagellate and animal relationships based on small subunit rDNA sequence, however, have yielded ambiguous and conflicting results. We find that analyses of four conserved proteins from a unicellular choanoflagellate, Monosiga brevicollis, provide robust support for a close relationship between choanoflagellates and Metazoa, suggesting that comparison of the complement of expressed genes from choanoflagellates and animals may be informative concerning the early evolution of metazoan genomes. We have discovered in M. brevicollis the first receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), to our knowledge, identified outside of the Metazoa, MBRTK1. The architecture of MBRTK1, which includes multiple extracellular ligand-binding domains, resembles that of RTKs in sponges and humans and suggests the ability to receive and transduce signals. Thus, choanoflagellates express genes involved in animal development that are not found in other eukaryotes and that may be linked to the origin of the Metazoa.\n      </p>", "Sequence evolution of the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene in retrotransposons belonging to the Ty1-copia class was studied in 11 plant species. Phylogenetic reconstruction of the evolutionary history of RT sequences indicated a strong pattern of purifying selection, manifested as high ratios of third to first plus second codon position substitutions, and low ratios of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site, especially in internal portions of the element phylogenies. Evidence of purifying selection was most pronounced in plant species with low estimated copy numbers of Ty1-copia elements. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that high element turnover rates (e.g., caused by high rates of element loss and selection against high element copy number) favors elements capable of transposition. Simulations of RT sequence evolution were conducted to help verify the logical validity of this conclusion. The results argue that it is incorrect to assume that low copy numbers of transposable elements are the product of reduced levels of element activity.\n      </p>", "The vomeronasal organ (VNO) detects pheromones in many vertebrate species but is likely to be vestigial in humans. TRPC2(TRP2), a gene that is essential for VNO function in the mouse, is a pseudogene in humans. Because TRPC2 is expressed only in the VNO, the loss of selective pressure on this gene can serve as a molecular marker for the time at which the VNO became vestigial. By analyzing sequence data from the TRPC2 gene of 15 extant primate species, we provide evidence that the VNO was most likely functional in the common ancestor of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys and apes, but then became vestigial in the common ancestor of Old World monkeys and apes. We propose that, at this point in evolution, other modalities, notably the development of color vision, may have largely replaced signaling by pheromones.\n      </p>", "Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is a 13-subunit protein complex that catalyzes the last step in mitochondrial electron transfer in mammals. Of the 10 subunits encoded by nuclear DNA (three are mtDNA products), some are expressed as tissue- and/or development-specific isoforms. For COX subunit VIII, previous work showed that expression of the contractile muscle-specific isoform gene, COX8H, is absent in humans and Old World monkeys, and the other isoform gene, COX8L, is expressed ubiquitously. Here, we show that COX8H is transcribed in most primate clades, but its expression is absent in catarrhines, that is, in Old World monkeys and hominids (apes, including humans), having become a pseudogene in the stem of the catarrhines. The ubiquitously expressed isoform, COX8L, underwent nonsynonymous rate acceleration and elevation in the ratio of nonsynonymous/synonymous changes in the stem of anthropoid primates (New World monkeys and catarrhines), possibly setting the stage for loss of the heart-type (H) isoform. The most rapidly evolving region of VIII-L is one that interacts with COX I, suggesting that the changes are functionally coadaptive. Because accelerated rates of nonsynonymous substitutions in anthropoids such as observed for COX8L are also shown by genes for at least 13 other electron transport chain components, these encoded amino acid replacements may be viewed as part of a series of coadaptive changes that optimized the anthropoid biochemical machinery for aerobic energy metabolism. We argue that these changes were linked to the evolution of an expanded neocortex in anthropoid primates.\n      </p>", "Understanding the pattern of speciation in a group of plants is critical for understanding its morphological evolution. Lepidium is the genus with the largest variation in floral structure in Brassicaceae, a family in which the floral ground plan is remarkably stable. However, flowers in more than half of Lepidium species have reduced stamen numbers, and most of these also have reduced petals. The species with reduced flowers are geographically biased, distributed mostly in the Americas and Australia/New Zealand. Previous phylogenetic studies using noncoding regions of chloroplast DNA and rDNA internal transcribed spacer were incongruent in most New World species relationships. These data, combined with the presence of many polyploid Lepidium species, implied a reticulate history of the genus but did not provide enough information to infer the evolutionary pattern of flower structures. To address this question more thoroughly, sequences of the first intron of a single copy nuclear gene, PISTILLATA, were determined from 43 species. Phylogenetic analysis of the PI intron suggests that many species in the New World have originated from allopolyploidization, and that this is correlated with floral reduction. Interspecific hybrids were generated to understand why allopolyploidization is associated with reduced flowers. The phenotypes of F1 flowers indicate allelic dominance of the absence of lateral stamens, suggesting that propagation of dominant alleles through interspecific hybridization could account for the abundance of the allopolyploid species without lateral stamens.\n      </p>", "We present here the description of genes coding for molluscan hemocyanins. Two distantly related mollusks, Haliotis tuberculata and Octopus dofleini, were studied. The typical architecture of a molluscan hemocyanin subunit, which is a string of seven or eight globular functional units (FUs, designated a to h, about 50 kDa each), is reflected by the gene organization: a series of eight structurally related coding regions in Haliotis, corresponding to FU-a to FU-h, with seven highly variable linker introns of 174 to 3,198 bp length (all in phase 1). In Octopus seven coding regions (FU-a to FU-g) are found, separated by phase 1 introns varying in length from 100 bp to 910 bp. Both genes exhibit typical signal (export) sequences, and in both cases these are interrupted by an additional intron. Each gene also contains an intron between signal peptide and FU-a and in the 3\u2032 untranslated region. Of special relevance for evolutionary considerations are introns interrupting those regions that encode a discrete functional unit. We found that five of the eight FUs in Haliotis each are encoded by a single exon, whereas FU-f, FU-g, and FU-a are encoded by two, three and four exons, respectively. Similarly, in Octopus four of the FUs each correspond to an uninterrupted exon, whereas FU-b, FU-e, and FU-f each contain a single intron. Although the positioning of the introns between FUs is highly conserved in the two mollusks, the introns within FUs show no relationship either in location nor phase. It is proposed that the introns between FUs were generated as the eight-unit polypeptide evolved from a monomeric precursor, and that the internal introns have been added later. A hypothesis for evolution of the ring-like quaternary structure of molluscan hemocyanins is presented.\n      </p>", "Generation of morphological diversity remains a challenge for evolutionary biologists because it is unclear how an ultimately finite number of genes involved in initial pattern formation integrates with morphogenesis. Ideally, models used to search for the simplest developmental principles on how genes produce form should account for both developmental process and evolutionary change. Here we present a model reproducing the morphology of mammalian teeth by integrating experimental data on gene interactions and growth into a morphodynamic mechanism in which developing morphology has a causal role in patterning. The model predicts the course of tooth-shape development in different mammalian species and also reproduces key transitions in evolution. Furthermore, we reproduce the known expression patterns of several genes involved in tooth development and their dynamics over developmental time. Large morphological effects frequently can be achieved by small changes, according to this model, and similar morphologies can be produced by different changes. This finding may be consistent with why predicting the morphological outcomes of molecular experiments is challenging. Nevertheless, models incorporating morphology and gene activity show promise for linking genotypes to phenotypes.\n      </p>", "Gene duplication creates evolutionary novelties by using older tools in new ways. We have identified evidence that the genes for enamel matrix proteins (EMPs), milk caseins, and salivary proteins comprise a family descended from a common ancestor by tandem gene duplication. These genes remain linked, except for one EMP gene, amelogenin. These genes show common structural features and are expressed in ontogenetically similar tissues. Many of these genes encode secretory Ca-binding phosphoproteins, which regulate the Ca-phosphate concentration of the extracellular environment. By exploiting this fundamental property, these genes have subsequently diversified to serve specialized adaptive functions. Casein makes milk supersaturated with Ca-phosphate, which was critical to the successive mammalian divergence. The innovation of enamel led to mineralized feeding apparatus, which enabled active predation of early vertebrates. The EMP genes comprise a subfamily not identified previously. A set of genes for dentine and bone extracellular matrix proteins constitutes an additional cluster distal to the EMP gene cluster, with similar structural features to EMP genes. The duplication and diversification of the primordial genes for enamel/dentine/bone extracellular matrix may have been important in core vertebrate feeding adaptations, the mineralized skeleton, the evolution of saliva, and, eventually, lactation. The order of duplication events may help delineate early events in mineralized skeletal formation, which is a major characteristic of vertebrates.\n      </p>", "Attempts to calibrate bacterial evolution have relied on the assumption that rates of molecular sequence divergence in bacteria are similar to those of higher eukaryotes, or to those of the few bacterial taxa for which ancestors can be reliably dated from ecological or geological evidence. Despite similarities in the substitution rates estimated for some lineages, comparisons of the relative rates of evolution at different classes of nucleotide sites indicate no basis for their universal application to all bacteria. However, there is evidence that bacteria have a constant genome-wide mutation rate on an evolutionary time scale but that this rate differs dramatically from the rate estimated by experimental methods.\n      </p>", "The hypothesis of the origin of consciousness is built upon the unique properties of the mammalian neocortex. The apical dendrites of the pyramidal cells bundle together as they ascend to lamina I to form neural receptor units of $\\thickapprox$ 100 apical dendrites plus branches receiving hundreds of thousands of excitatory synapses, the collective assemblage being called a dendron. It is proposed that the whole world of consciousness, the mental world, is microgranular, with mental units called psychons, and that in mind-brain interaction one psychon is linked to one dendron through quantum physics. The hypothesis is that in mammalian evolution dendrons evolved for more effective integration of the increased complexity of sensory inputs. These evolved dendrons had the capacity for interacting with psychons that came to exist, so forming the mental world and giving the mammal conscious experiences. In Darwinian evolution, consciousness would have occurred initially some 200 million years ago in relation to the primitive cerebral cortices of evolving mammals. It would give global experiences of a surrounding world for guiding behavior beyond what is given by the unconscious operation of sensory cortical areas per se. So conscious experiences would give mammals evolutionary advantage over the reptiles, which lack a neocortex giving consciousness. The Wulst of the avian brain needs further investigation to discover how it could give birds the consciousness that they seem to have.\n      </p>", "We introduce and analyze a general model of a population evolving over a network of selectively neutral genotypes. We show that the population's limit distribution on the neutral network is solely determined by the network topology and given by the principal eigenvector of the network's adjacency matrix. Moreover, the average number of neutral mutant neighbors per individual is given by the matrix spectral radius. These results quantify the extent to which populations evolve mutational robustness--the insensitivity of the phenotype to mutations--and thus reduce genetic load. Because the average neutrality is independent of evolutionary parameters--such as mutation rate, population size, and selective advantage--one can infer global statistics of neutral network topology by using simple population data available from in vitro or in vivo evolution. Populations evolving on neutral networks of RNA secondary structures show excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions.\n      </p>", "A theory for the evolution of cellular organization is presented. The model is based on the (data supported) conjecture that the dynamic of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is primarily determined by the organization of the recipient cell. Aboriginal cell designs are taken to be simple and loosely organized enough that all cellular componentry can be altered and/or displaced through HGT, making HGT the principal driving force in early cellular evolution. Primitive cells did not carry a stable organismal genealogical trace. Primitive cellular evolution is basically communal. The high level of novelty required to evolve cell designs is a product of communal invention, of the universal HGT field, not intralineage variation. It is the community as a whole, the ecosystem, which evolves. The individual cell designs that evolved in this way are nevertheless fundamentally distinct, because the initial conditions in each case are somewhat different. As a cell design becomes more complex and interconnected a critical point is reached where a more integrated cellular organization emerges, and vertically generated novelty can and does assume greater importance. This critical point is called the \"Darwinian Threshold\" for the reasons given.\n      </p>", "To study the evolution of the yeast protein interaction network, we first classified yeast proteins by their evolutionary histories into isotemporal categories, then analyzed the interaction tendencies within and between the categories, and finally reconstructed the main growth path. We found that two proteins tend to interact with each other if they are in the same or similar categories, but tended to avoid each other otherwise, and that network evolution mirrors the universal tree of life. These observations suggest synergistic selection during network evolution and provide insights into the hierarchical modularity of cellular networks.\n      </p>", "The genomic era revolutionized evolutionary biology. The enigma of genotypic-phenotypic diversity and biodiversity evolution of genes, genomes, phenomes, and biomes, reviewed here, was central in the research program of the Institute of Evolution, University of Haifa, since 1975. We explored the following questions. (i) How much of the genomic and phenomic diversity in nature is adaptive and processed by natural selection? (ii) What is the origin and evolution of adaptation and speciation processes under spatiotemporal variables and stressful macrogeographic and microgeographic environments? We advanced ecological genetics into ecological genomics and analyzed globally ecological, demographic, and life history variables in 1,200 diverse species across life, thousands of populations, and tens of thousands of individuals tested mostly for allozyme and partly for DNA diversity. Likewise, we tested thermal, chemical, climatic, and biotic stresses in several model organisms. Recently, we introduced genetic maps and quantitative trait loci to elucidate the genetic basis of adaptation and speciation. The genome-phenome holistic model was deciphered by the global regressive, progressive, and convergent evolution of subterranean mammals. Our results indicate abundant genotypic and phenotypic diversity in nature. The organization and evolution of molecular and organismal diversity in nature at global, regional, and local scales are nonrandom and structured; display regularities across life; and are positively correlated with, and partly predictable by, abiotic and biotic environmental heterogeneity and stress. Biodiversity evolution, even in small isolated populations, is primarily driven by natural selection, including diversifying, balancing, cyclical, and purifying selective regimes, interacting with, but ultimately overriding, the effects of mutation, migration, and stochasticity.\n      </p>", "The analysis of the tempo and mode of evolution has a strong tradition in paleontology. Recent advances in molecular phylogenetic reconstruction make it possible to complement this work by using data from extant species.\n      </p>", "The \"iterated prisoner's dilemma\" is the most widely used model for the evolution of cooperation in biological societies. Here we show that a heterogeneous population consisting of simple strategies, whose behavior is totally specified by the outcome of the previous round, can lead to persistent periodic or highly irregular (chaotic) oscillations in the frequencies of the strategies and the overall level of cooperation. The levels of cooperation jump up and down in an apparently unpredictable fashion. Small recurrent and simultaneous invasion attempts (caused by mutation) can change the evolutionary dynamics from converging to an evolutionarily stable strategy to periodic oscillations and chaos. Evolution can be twisted away from defection, toward cooperation. Adding \"generous tit-for-tat\" greatly increases the overall level of cooperation and can lead to long periods of steady cooperation. Since May's paper [May, R. M. (1976) Nature (London) 261, 459-467], \"simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics\" have been found in many biological applications, but here we provide an example of a biologically relevant evolutionary game whose dynamics display deterministic chaos. The simulations bear some resemblance to the irregular cycles displayed by the frequencies of host genotypes and specialized parasites in evolutionary \"arms races\" [Hamilton, W. D., Axelrod, R. \\&amp; Tanese, R. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87, 3566-3573; Seger, J. (1988) Philos. Trans. R. Soc. London B 319, 541-555].\n      </p>", "Homeostasis, the creation of a stabilized internal milieu, is ubiquitous in biological evolution, despite the entropic cost of excluding noise information from a region. The advantages of stability seem self evident, but the alternatives are not so clear. This issue was studied by means of numerical experiments on a simple evolution model: a population of Boolean network \"organisms\" selected for performance of a curve-fitting task while subjected to noise. During evolution, noise sensitivity increased with fitness. Noise exclusion evolved spontaneously, but only if the noise was sufficiently unpredictable. Noise that was limited to one or a few stereotyped patterns caused symmetry breaking that prevented noise exclusion. Instead, the organisms incorporated the noise into their function at little cost in ultimate fitness and became totally noise dependent. This \"noise imprinting\" suggests caution when interpreting apparent adaptations seen in nature. If the noise was totally random from generation to generation, noise exclusion evolved reliably and irreversibly, but if the noise was correlated over several generations, maladaptive selection of noise-dependent traits could reverse noise exclusion, with catastrophic effect on population fitness. Noise entering the selection process rather than the organism had a different effect: adaptive evolution was totally abolished above a critical noise amplitude, in a manner resembling a thermodynamic phase transition. Evolutionary adaptation to noise involves the creation of a subsystem screened from noise information but increasingly vulnerable to its effects. Similar considerations may apply to information channeling in human cultural evolution.\n      </p>", "Gene duplications are one of the primary driving forces in the evolution of genomes and genetic systems. Gene duplicates account for 8-20% of the genes in eukaryotic genomes, and the rates of gene duplication are estimated at between 0.2% and 2% per gene per million years. Duplicate genes are believed to be a major mechanism for the establishment of new gene functions and the generation of evolutionary novelty, yet very little is known about the early stages of the evolution of duplicated gene pairs. It is unclear, for example, to what extent selection, rather than neutral genetic drift, drives the fixation and early evolution of duplicate loci. Analysis of recently duplicated genes in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome reveals significantly reduced species-wide levels of nucleotide polymorphisms in the progenitor and/or duplicate gene copies, suggesting that selective sweeps accompany the initial stages of the evolution of these duplicated gene pairs. Our results support recent theoretical work that indicates that fates of duplicate gene pairs may be determined in the initial phases of duplicate gene evolution and that positive selection plays a prominent role in the evolutionary dynamics of the very early histories of duplicate nuclear genes.\n      </p>", "Evolution of viral genes is characterized by enormously high speed compared with that of nuclear genes of eukaryotic organisms. In this paper, the evolutionary rates and patterns of base substitutions are examined for retroviral oncogenes, human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), hepatitis B viruses (HBV), and influenza A viruses. Our results show that the evolutionary process of these viral genes can readily be explained by the netural theory of molecular evolution. In particular, the neutral theory is supported by our observation that synonymous substitutions always much predominate over nonsynonymous substitutions, even though the substitution rate varies considerably among the viruses. Furthermore, the exact correspondence between the high rates of evolutionary base substitutions and the high rates of production of mutants in RNA viruses fits very nicely to the prediction of the theory. The linear relationship between substitution numbers and time was examined to evaluate the clock-like property of viral evolution. The clock appears to be quite accurate in the influenza A viruses in man.\n      </p>", "The amplification of DNA by LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposons has created a large fraction of the human genome. To better understand their role in human evolution we endeavored to delineate the L1 elements that have amplified since the emergence of the hominid lineage. We used an approach based on shared sequence variants to trace backwards from the currently amplifying Ta subfamily. The newly identified groups of insertions account for much of the molecular evolution of human L1s. We report the identification of a L1 subfamily that amplified both before and after the divergence of humans from our closest extant relatives. Progressively more modern groups of L1s include greater numbers of insertions. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the rate of L1 amplification has been increasing during recent human evolution.\n      </p>", "Animals have evolved diverse appendages adapted for locomotion, feeding and other functions. The genetics underlying appendage formation are best understood in insects and vertebrates. The expression of the Distal-less (Dll) homeoprotein during arthropod limb outgrowth and of Dll orthologs (Dlx) in fish fin and tetrapod limb buds led us to examine whether expression of this regulatory gene may be a general feature of appendage formation in protostomes and deuterostomes. We find that Dll is expressed along the proximodistal axis of developing polychaete annelid parapodia, onychophoran lobopodia, ascidian ampullae, and even echinoderm tube feet. Dll/Dlx expression in such diverse appendages in these six coelomate phyla could be convergent, but this would have required the independent co-option of Dll/Dlx several times in evolution. It appears more likely that ectodermal Dll/Dlx expression along proximodistal axes originated once in a common ancestor and has been used subsequently to pattern body wall outgrowths in a variety of organisms. We suggest that this pre-Cambrian ancestor of most protostomes and the deuterostomes possessed elements of the genetic machinery for and may have even borne appendages.\n      </p>", "The Hox genes have been implicated as central to the evolution of animal body plan diversity. Regulatory changes both in Hox expression domains and in Hox-regulated gene networks have arisen during the evolution of related taxa, but there is little knowledge of whether functional changes in Hox proteins have also contributed to morphological evolution. For example, the evolution of greater numbers of differentiated segments and body parts in insects, compared with the simpler body plans of arthropod ancestors, may have involved an increase in the spectrum of biochemical interactions of individual Hox proteins. Here, we compare the in vivo functions of orthologous Ultrabithorax (Ubx) proteins from the insect Drosophila melanogaster and from an onychophoran, a member of a sister phylum with a more primitive and homonomous body plan. These Ubx proteins, which have been diverging in sequence for over 540 million years, can generate many of the same gain-of-function tissue transformations and can activate and repress many of the same target genes when expressed during Drosophila development. However, the onychophora Ubx (OUbx) protein does not transform the segmental identity of the embryonic ectoderm or repress the Distal-less target gene. This functional divergence is due to sequence changes outside the conserved homeodomain region. The inability of OUbx to function like Drosophila Ubx (DUbx) in the embryonic ectoderm indicates that the Ubx protein may have acquired new cofactors or activity modifiers since the divergence of the onychophoran and insect lineages.\n      </p>", "The nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily comprises, in addition to ligand-activated transcription factors, members for which no ligand has been identified to date. We demonstrate that orphan receptors are randomly distributed in the evolutionary tree and that there is no relationship between the position of a given liganded receptor in the tree and the chemical nature of its ligand. NRs are specific to metazoans, as revealed by a screen of NR-related sequences in early- and non-metazoan organisms. The analysis of the NR gene duplication pattern during the evolution of metazoans shows that the present NR diversity arose from two waves of gene duplications. Strikingly, our results suggest that the ancestral NR was an orphan receptor that acquired ligand-binding ability during subsequent evolution.\n      </p>", "The evolutionary origin of spliceosomal introns has been the subject of much controversy. Introns are proposed to have been both lost and gained during evolution. If the gain or loss of introns are unique events in evolution, they can serve as markers for phylogenetic analysis. We have made an extensive survey of the phylogenetic distribution of seven spliceosomal introns that are present in Fugu genes, but not in their mammalian homologues; we show that these introns were acquired by actinopterygian (ray-finned) fishes at various stages of evolution. We have also investigated the intron pattern of the rhodopsin gene in fishes, and show that the four introns found in the ancestral chordate rhodopsin gene were simultaneously lost in a common ancestor of ray-finned fishes. These changes in introns serve as excellent markers for phylogenetic analysis because they reliably define clades. Our intron-based cladogram establishes the difficult-to-ascertain phylogenetic relationships of some ray-finned fishes. For example, it shows that bichirs (Polypterus) are the sister group of all other extant ray-finned fishes.\n      </p>", "The current phylogenetic hypothesis for the evolution and biogeography of fiddler crabs relies on the assumption that complex behavioral traits are assumed to also be evolutionary derived. Indo-west Pacific fiddler crabs have simpler reproductive social behavior and are more marine and were thought to be ancestral to the more behaviorally complex and more terrestrial American species. It was also hypothesized that the evolution of more complex social and reproductive behavior was associated with the colonization of the higher intertidal zones. Our phylogenetic analysis, based upon a set of independent molecular characters, however, demonstrates how widely entrenched ideas about evolution and biogeography led to a reasonable, but apparently incorrect, conclusion about the evolutionary trends within this pantropical group of crustaceans. Species bearing the set of ``derived traits'' are phylogenetically ancestral, suggesting an alternative evolutionary scenario: the evolution of reproductive behavioral complexity in fiddler crabs may have arisen multiple times during their evolution. The evolution of behavioral complexity may have arisen by coopting of a series of other adaptations for high intertidal living and antipredator escape. A calibration of rates of molecular evolution from populations on either side of the Isthmus of Panama suggest a sequence divergence rate for 16S rRNA of 0.9% per million years. The divergence between the ancestral clade and derived forms is estimated to be $\\approx $22 million years ago, whereas the divergence between the American and Indo-west Pacific is estimated to be $\\approx $17 million years ago.\n      </p>", "Although the molecular evolution of protein tertiary structure and enzymatic activity has been studied for decades, little attention has been paid to the evolution of membrane protein topology. Here, we show that two closely related polytopic inner membrane proteins from Escherichia coli have evolved opposite orientations in the membrane, which apparently has been achieved by the selective redistribution of positively charged amino acids between the polar segments flanking the transmembrane stretches. This example of divergent evolution of membrane protein topology suggests that a complete inversion of membrane topology is possible with relatively few mutational changes even for proteins with multiple transmembrane segments.\n      </p>", "The internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA of 33 species of genus Paeonia (Paeoniaceae) were sequenced. In section Paeonia, different patterns of nucleotide additivity were detected in 14 diploid and tetraploid species at sites that are variable in the other 12 species of the section, suggesting that reticulate evolution has occurred. Phylogenetic relationships of species that do not show additivity, and thus ostensibly were not derived through hybridization, were reconstructed by parsimony analysis. The taxa presumably derived through reticulate evolution were then added to the phylogenetic tree according to additivity from putative parents. The study provides an example of successfully using ITS sequences to reconstruct reticulate evolution in plants and further demonstrates that the sequence data could be highly informative and accurate for detecting hybridization. Maintenance of parental sequences in the species of hybrid origin is likely due to slowing of concerted evolution caused by the long generation time of peonies. The partial and uneven homogenization of parental sequences displayed in nine species of putative hybrid origin may have resulted from gradients of gene conversion. The documented hybridizations may have occurred since the Pleistocene glaciations. The species of hybrid origin and their putative parents are now distantly allopatric. Reconstruction of reticulate evolution with sequence data, therefore, provides gene records for distributional histories of some of the parental species.\n      </p>", "Annual and perennial habit are two major strategies by which grasses adapt to seasonal environmental change, and these distinguish cultivated cereals from their wild relatives. Rhizomatousness, a key trait contributing to perenniality, was investigated by using an F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; population from a cross between cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) and its wild relative, Oryza longistaminata. Molecular mapping based on a complete simple sequence-repeat map revealed two dominant-complementary genes controlling rhizomatousness. Rhz3 was mapped to the interval between markers OSR16 [1.3 centimorgans (cM)] and OSR13 (8.1 cM) on rice chromosome 4 and Rhz2 located between RM119 (2.2 cM) and RM273 (7.4 cM) on chromosome 3. Comparative mapping indicated that each gene closely corresponds to major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling rhizomatousness in Sorghum propinquum, a wild relative of cultivated sorghum. Correspondence of these genes in rice and sorghum, which diverged from a common ancestor \u224850 million years ago, suggests that the two genes may be key regulators of rhizome development in many Poaceae. Many additional QTLs affecting abundance of rhizomes in O. longistaminata were identified, most of which also corresponded to the locations of S. propinquum QTLs. Convergent evolution of independent mutations at, in some cases, corresponding genes may have been responsible for the evolution of annual cereals from perennial wild grasses. DNA markers closely linked to Rhz2 and Rhz3 will facilitate cloning of the genes, which may contribute significantly to our understanding of grass evolution, advance opportunities to develop perennial cereals, and offer insights into environmentally benign weed-control strategies.\n      </p>", "Similar phenotypic changes have evolved independently in many animal taxa. It is unknown whether independent changes involve the same or different developmental and genetic mechanisms. Myriad pigment patterns in the genus Drosophila offer numerous opportunities to address this question. Previous studies identified regulatory and structural genes involved in the development and diversification of pigmentation in selected species. Here, we examine Drosophila americana and Drosophila novamexicana, interfertile species that have evolved dramatic pigmentation differences during the few million years since their divergence. Interspecific genetic analysis was used to investigate the contribution of five specific candidate genes and other genomic regions to phenotypic divergence by testing for associations between molecular markers and pigmentation. At least four distinct genomic regions contributed to pigmentation differences, one of which included the ebony gene. Ebony protein was expressed at higher levels in the more yellow D. novamexicana than the heavily melanized D. americana. Because Ebony promotes yellow pigment formation and suppresses melanization, the expression difference and genetic association suggest that evolution at the ebony locus contributed to pigmentation divergence between D. americana and D. novamexicana. Surprisingly, no genetic association with the yellow locus was detected in this study, and Yellow expression was identical in the two species. Evolution at the yellow locus underlies pigmentation divergence among other Drosophila species; thus, similar pigment patterns have evolved through regulatory changes in different genes in different lineages. These findings bear upon understanding classic models of melanism and mimicry.\n      </p>", "Biological speciation ultimately results in prezygotic isolation--the inability of incipient species to mate with one another-but little is understood about the selection pressures and genetic changes that generate this outcome. The genus Chlamydomonas comprises numerous species of unicellular green algae, including numerous geographic isolates of the species C. reinhardtii. This diverse collection has allowed us to analyze the evolution of two sex-related genes: the mid gene of C. reinhardtii, which determines whether a gamete is mating-type plus or minus, and the fus1 gene, which dictates a cell surface glycoprotein utilized by C. reinhardtii plus gametes to recognize minus gametes. Low stringency Southern analyses failed to detect any fus1 homologs in other Chlamydomonas species and detected only one mid homolog, documenting that both genes have diverged extensively during the evolution of the lineage. The one mid homolog was found in C. incerta, the species in culture that is most closely related to C. reinhardtii. Its mid gene carries numerous nonsynonymous and synonymous codon changes compared with the C. reinhardtii mid gene. In contrast, very high sequence conservation of both the mid and fus1 sequences is found in natural isolates of C. reinhardtii, indicating that the genes are not free to drift within a species but do diverge dramatically between species. Striking divergence of sex determination and mate recognition genes also has been encountered in a number of other eukaryotic phyla, suggesting that unique, and as yet unidentified, selection pressures act on these classes of genes during the speciation process.\n      </p>", "Biological diversity has evolved despite the essentially infinite complexity of protein sequence space. We present a hierarchical approach to the efficient searching of this space and quantify the evolutionary potential of our approach with Monte Carlo simulations. These simulations demonstrate that nonhomologous juxtaposition of encoded structure is the rate-limiting step in the production of new tertiary protein folds. Nonhomologous \"swapping\" of low-energy secondary structures increased the binding constant of a simulated protein by \u2248 107 relative to base substitution alone. Applications of our approach include the generation of new protein folds and modeling the molecular evolution of disease.\n      </p>", "Most species maintain abundant genetic variation and experience a range of environmental conditions, yet phenotypic variation is low. That is, development is robust to changes in genotype and environment. It has been claimed that this robustness, termed canalization, evolves because of long-term natural selection for optimal phenotypes. We show that the developmental process, here modeled as a network of interacting transcriptional regulators, constrains the genetic system to produce canalization, even without selection toward an optimum. The extent of canalization, measured as the insensitivity to mutation of a network's equilibrium state, depends on the complexity of the network, such that more highly connected networks evolve to be more canalized. We argue that canalization may be an inevitable consequence of complex developmental-genetic processes and thus requires no explanation in terms of evolution to suppress phenotypic variation.\n      </p>", "Eusociality is a major evolutionary innovation involving alterations in life history, morphology, and behavior. Advanced eusocial insects, such as ants, termites, and corbiculate bees, cannot provide insights into the earliest stages of eusocial evolution because eusociality in these taxa evolved long ago (in the Cretaceous) and close solitary relatives are no longer extant. In contrast, primitively eusocial insects, such as halictid bees, provide insights into the early stages of eusocial evolution because eusociality has arisen recently and repeatedly. By mapping social behavior onto well-corroborated phylogenies, I show that eusociality has arisen only three times within halictid bees (contrary to earlier estimates of six or more origins). Reversals from eusocial to solitary behavior have occurred as many as 12 times, indicating that social reversals are common in the earliest stages of eusocial evolution. Important attributes of social complexity (e.g., colony size, queen/worker dimorphism) show no obvious association with phylogeny, and some reversals to solitary nesting are related to host-plant switches (from polylecty to oligolecty). These results provide a glimpse of social evolution in its earliest stages and provide insights into the early evolution of advanced eusocial organisms.\n      </p>", "The process of gene unscrambling in hypotrichous ciliates represents one of nature's ingenious solutions to the problem of gene assembly. With some essential genes scrambled in as many as 51 pieces, these ciliates rely on sequence and structural cues to rebuild their fragmented genes and genomes. Here we report the complex pattern of scrambling in the DNA polymerase \u03b1 gene of Stylonychia lemnae. The germline (micronuclear) copy of this gene is broken into 48 pieces with 47 dispersed over two loci, with no asymmetry in the placement of coding segments on either strand. Direct repeats present at the boundaries between coding and noncoding sequences provide pointers to help guide assembly of the functional (macronuclear) gene. We investigate the evolution of this complex gene in three hypotrichous species.\n      </p>", "Mate finding in most moth species involves long-distance signaling via female-emitted sex pheromones. There is a great diversity of pheromone structures used throughout the Lepidoptera, even among closely related species. The conundrum is how signal divergence has occurred. With strong normalizing selection pressure on blend composition and response preferences, it is improbable that shifts to pheromones of diverse structures occur through adaptive changes in small steps. Here, we present data supporting the hypothesis that a major shift in the pheromone of an Ostrinia species occurred by activation of a nonfunctional desaturase gene transcript present in the pheromone gland. We also demonstrate the existence of rare males that respond to the new pheromone blend. Their presence would allow for asymmetric tracking of male response to the new blend and, thus, evolution of an Ostrinia species with structurally different sex pheromone components.\n      </p>", "We report in this paper an evolutionary experiment on Drosophila that tested life-history theory and the evolutionary theory of aging. As theory predicts, higher extrinsic mortality rates did lead to the evolution of higher intrinsic mortality rates, to shorter lifespans, and to decreased age and size at eclosion; peak fecundity also shifted earlier in life. These results confirm the key role of extrinsic mortality rates in the evolution of growth, maturation, reproduction, and aging, and they do so with a selection regime that maintained selection on fertility throughout life while holding population densities constant.\n      </p>", "Evolution is, in a sense, to resolve optimization problems. Our neo-Darwinian algorithm based on the mechanics of inheritance and natural selection uses double-stranded DNA-type genetic information to resolve the \"knapsack problem.\" The algorithm with asymmetrical mutations due to semiconservative DNA-type replication most effectively resolved the problem. Our results strongly suggest that disparity in mutations caused by the asymmetric machinery of DNA replication promotes evolution, in particular of diploid organisms with a high mutation rate, in a small population, and under strong selection pressure.\n      </p>"], "words": {"results": {"number": 1}, "gc": {"number": 1}, "abundant": {"number": 1}, "feeding": {"number": 1}, "physiological":

Many observers of the fight felt that Lewis had clearly outperformed Holyfield; dissatisfaction with the result-particularly the pro-Holyfield score-card of judge Eugenia Williams-fuelled speculation that the fight had been fixed and prompted official investigations. In this paper, we examine whether the official judges scored the fight in a significantly different way from other professional observers of the fight. We do so by analysing the round-by-round scoring within the context of interrater agreement. The literature on interrater agreement typically considers a large number of samples rated by a small number of judges and relies on asymptotic results for tests. In our case, the sample size is too small to rely on asymptotics. Instead, we investigate several techniques that can be applied to small sample interrater agreement problems, including logistic regression, an exact test and some Bayesian approaches. We demonstrate these methods on both the March 1999 Holyfield-Lewis fight, as well as the September 1999 bout between welter-weights Oscar de la Hoya and Felix Trinidad.\n      </p>", "The British Medical Association wants to criminalise all boxing.

Here, the progress towards developing tsunami inundation modelling tools for use in inundation forecasting is discussed historically from the perspective of hydrodynamics. The state-of-knowledge before the 26 December 2004 tsunami is described. Remaining aspects for future research are identified. One, validated inundation models need to be further developed through benchmark testing and instrumental tsunameter measurements and standards for operational codes need to be established. Two, a methodology is needed to better quantify short-duration impact forces on structures. Three, the mapping of vulnerable continental margins to identify unrecognized hazards must proceed expeditiously, along with palaeotsunami research to establish repeat intervals. Four, the development of better coupling between deforming seafloor motions and model initialization needs further refinement. Five, in an era of global citizenship, more comprehensive educational efforts on tsunami hazard mitigation are necessary worldwide.\n      </p>", "Objective: To evaluate the risk of chronic traumatic brain injury from amateur boxing. Setting: Secondary research performed by combination of sport physicians and clinical academics. Design, data sources, and methods: Systematic review of observational studies in which chronic traumatic brain injury was defined as any abnormality on clinical neurological examination, psychometric testing, neuroimaging studies, and electroencephalography. Studies were identified through database (1950 to date) and bibliographic searches without language restrictions. Two reviewers extracted study characteristics, quality, and data, with adherence to a protocol developed from a widely recommended method for systematic review of observational studies (MOOSE). Results: 36 papers had relevant extractable data (from a detailed evaluation of 93 studies of 943 identified from the initial search). Quality of evidence was generally poor. The best quality studies were those with a cohort design and those that used psychometric tests. These yielded the most negative results: only four of 17 (24%) better quality studies found any indication of chronic traumatic brain injury in a minority of boxers studied. Conclusion: There is no strong evidence to associate chronic traumatic brain injury with amateur boxing.\n      </p>", "Statistics of injuries arising in amateur boxing in the Royal Air Force in the 14 years 1953-66 are given. There were 240 injuries including two deaths in the 14 years.

Here, we present parasite resistance as a two-step process in which hosts must first detect parasites and then eradicate them; failure at either step results in infection. The model incorporates 'matching-allele' (MA) genetics for detection and 'gene-for-gene' (GFG) genetics for eradication. We found that the oscillatory dynamics were similar to pure GFG genetics when the cost of Virulence' alleles was low, but resembled pure MA genetics when the cost was high. The magnitude of the cost that switched the dynamics from GFG dominated to MA dominated depended on the genetic architecture of defence (i.e. the number of GFG and MA loci).\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

This shows that the set theoretic representation format used in the structuralist approach to the philosophy of science also applies to the domain of genetic theories. The reconstruction is intended to lend more clarity to the methodological, philosophical and didactical discussions of the foundations of genetics, and on the other hand to defend a formally, logically minded view of theories which seems to have become contested through the work of Feyerabend, Kuhn and Kitcher.\n      </p>", "Many prospective studies have reported associations between circulating C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), but causality remains uncertain. Studies of CHD are being conducted that involve measurement of common polymorphisms of the CRP gene known to be associated with circulating concentrations, thereby utilising these variants as proxies for circulating CRP levels. By analysing data from several studies examining the association between relevant CRP polymorphisms and CHD risk, the present collaboration will undertake a Mendelian randomisation analysis to help assess the likelihood of any causal relevance of CRP levels to CHD risk. A central database is being established containing individual data on CRP polymorphisms, circulating CRP levels, and major coronary outcomes as well as age, sex and other relevant characteristics. Associations between CRP polymorphisms or haplotypes and CHD will be evaluated under different circumstances. This collaboration comprises, at present, about 37,000 CHD outcomes and about 120,000 controls, which should yield suitably precise findings to help judge causality. This work should advance understanding of the relevance of low-grade inflammation to CHD and indicate whether or not CRP itself is involved in long-term pathogenesis.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Traditionally, this task has fallen on geneticists who systematically perturb gene function and study the consequences. With the advent of large, easily accessible, small-molecule libraries and new methods of chemical synthesis, biologists now have new ways to probe gene function. Often called chemical genetics, this approach involves the screening of compounds that perturb a process of interest. In this scenario, each perturbing chemical is analogous to a specific mutation.

It shows on the one side that agricultural research and higher education institutions have played a key role in the development and institutionalization of genetics in France, whereas university biologists remained reluctant to accept this approach on heredity. But on the other side, plant breeders, and agricultural researchers, despite an interest in Mendelism, never came to see it as the breeders' panacea, and regarded it instead as of only limited value for plant breeding. I account for this judgment in showing that the plant breeders and Mendelism designed two contrasting kinds of experimental systems and inhabited distinct experimental cultures. While Mendelian geneticists designed experimental systems that allowed the production of definite ratios of different forms that varied in relation to a few characters, plant breeders' experimental systems produced a wide range of variation, featuring combinations between hundreds of traits. Rather than breaking this multiple variation down into simple elements, breeders designed and monitored a genetic lottery. The gene was a unit in a Mendelian experimental culture, an \"epistemic thing\" as Rheinberger put it, that could be grasped by means of statistical regularities, but it remained of secondary importance for French plant breeders, for whom the strain or the variety -- not the gene -- was the fundamental unit of analysis and manipulation.\n      </p>", "Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis of the co-citation patterns of fortynine authors are used to investigate changes in the structure of Drosophila genetics literature over the years 1974-78 and 1979-83. This literature is shown to consist of a central set of author clusters representing classical genetics, surrounded by more specialized research clusters: developmental genetics, molecular genetics, neurogenetics, and population genetics. The co-cited author structure illustrates the general intellectual historical development of Drosophila genetics and is extremely stable over time. Visible changes in research patterns include the increased prominence of neurogenetics and the cross-cluster migration of individual authors. The overall stability derives from (1) the greater citation visibility and inertia of the author's oeuvre as the unit of analysis (in contrast to individual documents) and (2) temporal characteristics of the journal article as a formal archival record of research activity. Interpretations and hypotheses must take these into account.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

To prevent such abuse, it is essential to have clear, formal principles as well as algorithms for distinguishing genetics from eugenics. This work identifies essential distinctions between eugenics and genetics in the implied nature of the social contract and the importance ascribed to individual welfare relative to society. Rawls's construction of 'justice a fairness' is used as a model for how a formal systems of ethics can be used to proscribe eugenic practices. Rawls's synthesis can be applied to this problem if it is assumed that in the original condition all individuals are ignorant of their genetic constitution and unwilling to consent to social structures which may constrain their own potential. The principles of fairness applied of genetics require that genetic interventions be directed at extending individual liberties and be applied to the greatest benefit of individuals with the least advantages. These principles are incompatible with negative eugenics which would further penalize those with genetic disadvantage. These principles limit positive eugenics to those practices which are designed to provide absolute benfit to those individuals with least advantage, are acceptable to its subjects, and further a system of basic equal liberties. This analysis also illustrates how simple deviations from first principles in Rawls's formulation could countenance eugenic applications of genetic technologies.\n      </p>", "Low caloric intake (caloric restriction) can lengthen the life span of a wide range of animals and possibly even of humans. To understand better how caloric restriction lengthens life span, we used genetic methods and criteria to investigate its mechanism of action in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Mutations in many genes (eat genes) result in partial starvation of the worm by disrupting the function of the pharynx, the feeding organ. We found that most eat mutations significantly lengthen life span (by up to 50%). In C. elegans, mutations in a number of other genes that can extend life span have been found. Two genetically distinct mechanisms of life span extension are known: a mechanism involving genes that regulate dauer formation (age-1, daf-2, daf-16, and daf-28) and a mechanism involving genes that affect the rate of development and behavior (clk-1, clk-2, clk-3, and gro-1). We find that the long life of eat-2 mutants does not require the activity of DAF-16 and that eat-2; daf-2 double mutants live even longer than extremely long-lived daf-2 mutants. These findings demonstrate that food restriction lengthens life span by a mechanism distinct from that of dauer-formation mutants. In contrast, we find that food restriction does not further increase the life span of long-lived clk-1 mutants, suggesting that clk-1 and caloric restriction affect similar processes.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Kappa chains of seven Inv (-1,3) homozygotes had valine, while those of three Inv (1,3) heterozygotes had some chains with leucine and some with valine at this position. Genes encoding the Inv (1) and Inv (3) variants appear to be expressed equally in the heterozygous state, since approximately equal amounts of each gene product was recovered from heterozygotes. The correlation between Inv phenotype and the amino acid residue present at position 191 is identical to that previously established for \u03ba -type Bence-Jones proteins and myeloma protein light chains.

With widespread acceptance that nearly all behavioral variation reflects some genetic influence, current studies are investigating developmental changes in the nature and magnitude of genetic and environmental effects, the extent to which different behaviors are influenced by common genes, and different forms of gene-environment correlation and interaction. New designs, focused on assessment of unrelated children in the same households or neighborhood environments, and use of measured environmental variables within genetically informative designs, are yielding more incisive evidence of common environmental effects on behavior. What will be next? Behavior genetic techniques and analyses will be used to inform efforts to find genes altering susceptibility for disorder and dispositional genes affecting behavioral variation. The developing integration of behavioral and molecular genetics will identify genes influencing specific behavioral variation and enhance understanding of how they do so.

Population-specific human-genetics research has become commonplace but remains controversial, as its results can affect public and personal perceptions of the ethnic, national, and racial groups studied. Choice of populations for study has generally seemed a function of scientific, logistical, or economic factors. RESEARCH QUESTION. Has the identity of populations studied in the human-genetics research literature varied systematically, and, if it has, in what ways? METHODS. I searched the PubMed database for population-genetics reports, calculating for each a population score, a genetics score, and a mutation score. RESULTS. Some populations had been studied far more intensively than others. Many of the most frequently studied groups were ethnically defined and politically marginal in their home countries; some of these groups were involved in self-determination struggles. In the mutation-research literature, state-defined Muslim and Mediterranean populations prevailed. CONCLUSION. Study-population selection may in some cases be explained by, or may complicate, political predicament.\n      </p>", "Behavior genetics has demonstrated that genetic variance is an important component of variation for all behavioral outcomes, but variation among families is not. These results have led some critics of behavior genetics to conclude that heritability is so ubiquitous as to have few consequences for scientific understanding of development, while some behavior genetic partisans have concluded that family environment is not an important cause of developmental outcomes. Both views are incorrect. Genotype is in fact a more systematic source of variability than environment, but for reasons that are methodological rather than substantive. Development is fundamentally nonlinear, interactive, and difficult to control experimentally. Twin studies offer a useful methodological shortcut, but do not show that genes are more fundamental than environments.\n      </p>", "This study examines the dynamics of a competition and a host-parasite model in which the interactions are determined by quantitative characters. Both models are extensions of one-dimensional difference equations that can exhibit complicated dynamics. Compared to these basic models, the phenotypic variability given by the quantitative characters reduces the size of the density fluctuations in asexual populations. With sexual reproduction, which is described by modeling the genetics of the quantitative character explicitly with many haploid loci that determine the character additively, this reduction in fitness variance is magnified. Moreover, quantitative genetics can induce simple dynamics. For example, the sexual population can have a two-cycle when the asexual system is chaotic. This paper discusses the consequences for the evolution of sex. The higher mean growth rate implied by the lower fitness variance in sexual populations is an advantage that can overcome a twofold intrinsic growth rate of asexuals. The advantage is bigger when the asexual population contains only a subset of the phenotypes present in the sexual population, which conforms with the tangled bank theory for the evolution of sex and shows that tangled bank effects also occur in host-parasite systems. The results suggest that explicitly describing the genetics of a quantitative character leads to more flexible models than the usual assumption of normal character distributions, and therefore to a better understanding of the character's impact on population dynamics.\n      </p>", "We describe a strategy for quickly identifying and positionally mapping human homologs of yeast genes to cross-reference the biological and genetic information known about yeast genes to mammalian chromosomal maps. Optimized computer search methods have been developed to scan the rapidly expanding expressed sequence tag (EST) data base to find human open reading frames related to yeast protein sequence queries. These methods take advantage of the newly developed BLOSUM scoring matrices and the query masking function SEG. The corresponding human cDNA is then used to obtain a high-resolution map position on human and mouse chromosomes, providing the links between yeast genetic analysis and mapped mammalian loci. By using these methods, a human homolog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC27 has been identified and mapped to human chromosome 17 and mouse chromosome 11 between the Pkca and Erbb-2 genes. Human CDC27 encodes an 823-aa protein with global similarity to its fungal homologs CDC27, nuc2+, and BimA. Comprehensive cross-referencing of genes and mutant phenotypes described in humans, mice, and yeast should accelerate the study of normal eukaryotic biology and human disease states.\n      </p>", "By use of human-mouse somatic cell hybrids, an autosomal gene linkage has been determined for the human loci controlling the phenotypes of lactate dehydrogenase-A (EC 1.1.1.27) and esterase-A4 (EC 3.1.1.2). These structural loci were not linked to the lactate dehydrogenase-B, peptidase-B linkage, the X chromosome, the E17 chromosome, or to nine other enzyme phenotypes examined.\n      </p>", "The rapid development of biological technology in recent years has generated an overwhelming quantity of highly complex genetical data. In retrospect it is perhaps now obvious that standard stochastic sampling algorithms were destined to fail when applied to the type of models that these data require. During this period, both the genetics and statistics research communities have developed a range of new algorithms that have endeavored to avoid these failures. This article presents a brief journey through the development of some of these algorithms. I hope to demonstrate that continued collaborative research and education in both genetics and statistics disciplines is crucial for the advancement of future sampling frameworks, and call on researchers in both fields to take up this challenge.\n      </p>", "We selected peptide aptamers from combinatorial libraries that disrupted cell-cycle arrest caused by mating pheromone in yeast. We used these aptamers as baits in two-hybrid hunts to identify genes involved in cell-cycle arrest. These experiments identified genes known to function in the pathway, as well as a protein kinase, the CBK1 product, whose function was not known. We used a modified two-hybrid system to identify specific interactions disrupted by these aptamers. These experiments demonstrate a means to perform \"genetics\" on the protein complement of a cell without altering its genetic material. Peptide aptamers can be identified that disrupt a process. These aptamers can then be used as affinity reagents to identify individual proteins and protein interactions needed for the process. Forward genetic analysis with peptide aptamer \"mutagens\" should be particularly useful in clucidating genetic networks in organisms and processes for which classical genetics is not feasible.\n

by becoming \"survivalist entrepreneurs,\" that is, persons who start marginal businesses in response to a need to become self-employed. Applying this theory, I analyze survivalist entrepreneurship among Black women in the urban North during the Great Depression, when many Black women had to find an independent means of livelihood. I hypothesize that (1) the participation of Black women in entrepreneurial occupations, i.e., occupations that lend themselves to self-employment, was positively associated with the disadvantage of these women in the labor market and (2) Black women would be inclined to participate in those entrepreneurial occupations with low barriers to entry, namely, boarding and lodging house keeping and hairdressing and beauty culture. These occupations, according to a review of historical studies, provided northern Black women with their best opportunities for survivalist entrepreneurship. The analyses of census data support my hypotheses and suggest that the resource constraint version of the disadvantage theory of entrepreneurship is relevant to the economic adjustment strategies of northern Black women during the nation's worst employment crisis.\n      </p>", "Explanations of variability in public opinion on crime have drawn disproportionately from the literature on specific symbolic orientations including religious fundamentalism and racial prejudice.

Controlling for all other predictors, the personal survivalism index was the most powerful predictor of prostitution acceptability, followed by the country-level survivalism index.

First, it discusses the resources, constraints, and interests of the ministry of finance at the central government level. Second, it focuses on the roles the ministry of finance has played over time in Chinese economic policy making. These include a passive survivalist role; a bureaucratic interest group within three different types of coalitions; as a contender for power; and as a restorer of balance. Third, the roles the ministry plays are related to several broad independent variables, such as the political and economic climates, and the degree of financial centralization and decentralization. These structural variables are more effective in explaining the roles of the ministry than are ministry leadership variables.\n      </p>", "Despite public promises to the contrary, Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia continue to be ruled autocratically even as their civil societies aspire to greater public space. Rather than promoting concrete steps towards democratization including institutionalizing freedom of speech, association, and pluralistic political practices, the three states of the Maghrib are pursuing survivalist strategies leading to a robust authoritarianism that seems unlikely to be overturned anytime soon. Yet failure to transform authoritarian politics dramatically and decisively into a sustainable democracy will not only hamper long-term socioeconomic development but, more ominously, foster an environment within which radical forces will emerge to threaten domestic as well as regional and global stability. Current American efforts to promote democratic reform in the region must evolve more imaginatively if they are to meet the challenge of global terrorism that itself is so deeply embedded within the authoritarian impulse that can only be overcome through the democratic imperative.\n      </p>", "The dichotomous images of Jessica Lynch, a West Virginia soldier who was rescued from an Iraqi hospital in 2003, and Lynndie England, another West Virginia soldier whose picture became synonymous with prison abuse in Iraq in 2004, have necessitated a feminist contribution to the theorizing of the hillbilly as a cultural icon. This article examines historical, political, and literary contexts for diverting attention to the hillbilly as a defense against criticism of America as an uncivilized nation, connecting the narratives of Lynch and England with accounts of Eric Rudolph, a supposed mountaineer survivalist who in 2005 was convicted of bombing abortion clinics, a lesbian bar, and an Olympic celebration.

We follow the Lewis-model distinction between a traditional and modern sector and underpin this distinction with micro-foundations. We specify mature and start-up entrepreneurs and make a distinction between survivalist self-employment activities in the traditional sector and opportunity-driven entrepreneurship in the modern. The model shows how opportunity-driven entrepreneurship can drive structural transformation in both the modern and traditional sectors through innovation and the provision of intermediate inputs and services (which permits greater specialization in manufacturing) and by increasing employment and productivity.\n      </p>", "This survey argues that the substantial sub-genre of SF cinema which has entertained visions of nuclear Armageddon primarily concerns itself with survival as its dominant discursive mode, not disaster as suggested by Susan Sontag. From the early post-Hiroshima films which anticipated global atomic conflict, the '50s cautionary tales of short- and long-term effects, through to '80s hero myths of apocalypse, a discernable shift away from an imagination of disaster toward one of survival is evident. These films have drawn upon pre-existing mythologies of cataclysm and survival in their renderings of post-holocaust life, the most potent being a recasting of the Judeo-Christian messianic hero. The cinematic renderings of long-term post-nuclear survival appear highly reactionary, and seemingly advocate reinforcing the symbolic order of the status quo via the maintenance of conservative social regimes of patriarchal law (and lore). In this way the post-nuclear survivalist cycle of the '80s has signified another mode by which a generation has learned to stop worrying and love-if not the bomb-a (post-holocaust) future, which promises a compelling, utopian fantasy of a biblical Eden reborn in an apocalyptic millennia of peace on Earth.\n      </p>", "Lichens, a symbiotic relationship between a fungus (mycobiont) and a photosynthetic green algae or cyanobacteria (photobiont), belong to an elite group of survivalist organisms termed resurrection species. When lichens are desiccated, they are photosynthetically inactive, but upon rehydration they can perform photosynthesis within seconds. Desiccation is correlated with both a loss of variable chlorophyll a fluorescence and a decrease in overall fluorescence yield. The fluorescence quenching likely reflects photoprotection mechanisms that may be based on desiccation-induced changes in lichen structure that limit light exposure to the photobiont (sunshade effect) and /or active quenching of excitation energy absorbed by the photosynthetic apparatus. To separate and quantify these possible mechanisms, we have investigated the origins of fluorescence quenching in desiccated lichens with steady-state, low temperature, and time-resolved chlorophyll fluorescence spectroscopy. We found the most dramatic target of quenching to be photosystem II (PSII), which produces negligible levels of fluorescence in desiccated lichens. We show that fluorescence decay in desiccated lichens was dominated by a short lifetime, long-wavelength component energetically coupled to PSII. Remaining fluorescence was primarily from PSI and although diminished in amplitude, PSI decay kinetics were unaffected by desiccation. The long-wavelength-quenching species was responsible for most (about 80%) of the fluorescence quenching observed in desiccated lichens; the rest of the quenching was attributed to the sunshade effect induced by structural changes in the lichen thallus.\n      </p>", "Das Ziel dieser Studie war es, in Marabastad die Verkn\u00fcpfung zwischen formellen und informellen Sektor, sowie dessen innere Heterogenit\u00e4t zu untersuchen.

The link to formal business was not as strong as reported in other studies and no significant clustering of hawkers could be found in the statistical analysis. The findings pose a major challenge to policy-makers and role-players in Marabastad because it will be difficult to promote informal enterprises without a significant reduction of their number.

This article describes the findings of an in-depth, in situ study of an informal-economy subsistence marketplace in South India. Through interviews with consumers and owners of survivalist microenterprises, the authors identify seven themes that characterize the subsistence marketplace context, buyer-seller interactions within them, and specific elements of exchange. Drawing on these findings, along with theories of social capital and consumption in poverty, they make the case that business policy in developing countries should aim to empower subsistence entrepreneurs and consumers, embrace emergent solutions, help build bridges between informal and formal economies, and adopt a bottom-up orientation to policy development.

Three points are offered to nuance this concept in today's complex political-economic times. First, we need to identify local governances as more vibrant and active in engaging capital. Whereas Peck and Tickell present a constricted, moribund local governance, I posit this formation as surprisingly active (i.e. it accepts and spurns fractions of capital). Second, we need to recognise the importance of the national scale in structuring governance-driven economic development. While Peck and Tickell posit an essentially 'hollowed out', unimportant national scale, I suggest that this scale continues to house an important resource routinely tapped by local economic development actors: nationalist ideologies. Third, we need to identify the most recent survivalist strategy used by local governances: the deploying of the 'economy of fear' generally and the 'global trope' in particular. Peck and Tickell provide little specificity about this governance's ability to negotiate turbulence and contradiction. These points are meant as refinements of a thesis that I suggest is still important in guiding our understanding of contemporary economic development policy in the UK and US.\n      </p>", "Data were collected on annual (1980-1983) and seasonal (spring vs. summer) variation in reproduction by the double-brooded Eastern Phoebe (Sayornis phoebe) to test the proposal that phoebes modify reproductive patterns on a seasonal basis and switch from being brood survivalists in spring to brood reductionists in summer. Clutch size did not differ between spring and summer broods nor among years, but spring nests fledged one more nestling than summer nests. In 1981 breeding began earlier, eggs were larger, and nestlings grew faster than in all other years. Clutch size and egg mass within spring clutches increased seasonally. Egg mass was also larger in summer clutches. These observations suggest that food is usually limited during the initiation of spring clutches. However, because spring broods were more productive than summer broods, I predicted that phoebes should act as brood survivalists in spring, but become brood reductionists in summer. All predictions were supported. During the spring: (a) clutches hatched synchronously; (b) egg mass increased significantly with laying order; (c) hatch order had little impact on nestling growth and; (d) last-hatched young fledged as frequently as their siblings. However, during the summer: (a) clutches hatched asynchronously; (b) egg mass did not consistently vary with laying sequence; (c) hatch order had a significant negative impact on growth; and (d) last-hatched young fledged only about 50% of the time. Thus, phoebes seemed to adaptively shift reproductive patterns seasonally, switching from a brood-survivalist strategy in spring to a brood-reductionist strategy in summer. However, I suggest that proximate responses to food availability provide a more parsimonious explanation for the observed patterns. The increase in egg mass with laying sequence was most likely the result of progressive increases in food availability in spring. Higher food availability and reduced energy demands during summer probably also allowed females to lay uniformly large eggs and start incubation sooner. The latter resulted in greater hatching asynchrony in summer clutches. The poorer growth and higher mortality of last-hatched young in summer resulted from a severe size disadvantage that was the result of the greater asynchrony of summer broods. Thus, brood reduction in summer was probably an incidental and nonadaptive outcome of hatching asynchrony.\n      </p>", "This article examines the interplay of agency, culture and context in order to consider the social embeddedness of money and trade at the margins of South Africa's economy. Focusing on small-scale, survivalist informal enterprise operators, it draws on socio-cultural analysis to explore the social dynamics involved in generating and managing wealth. After describing the informal sector in South Africa, the article elucidates the relationship between money and economic informality. First, diverse objectives, typically irreducible to the maximization of profit, animate those in the informal sector and challenge meta-narratives of a 'great transformation' towards socially disembedded and depersonalized economic relationships. Second, regimes of economic governance, both state-led and informal, shape the terrain on which informal economic activity occurs in complex and constitutive ways. Third, local idioms and practices of trading, managing money and negotiating social claims similarly configure economic activities. Fourth, and finally, encroaching and often inexorable processes of formalization differentially influence those in the informal sector. The analysis draws on these findings to recapitulate both the ubiquity and centrality of the sociality at the heart of economy, and to examine the particular forms they take in South Africa's informal economy.

The author documents and analyzes three subcultures' constructions of Y2K. The three subcultures are millennial (Evangelical-Charismatic-Pentecostal) Christians, militia-patriot survivalists, and computer professionals. Each subculture interpreted, received, comprehended, and explained the cultural object of Y2K. Combining the data from content analysis and interviews, the author creates a detailed picture of each subculture's response to Y2K. She compares and contrasts the three subcultures. Each subculture created a subcultural filter based on previously held value and belief systems, attitudes toward technology and computers, and interpretations of social environments to create a unique picture of Y2K. She examines how each of the subcultures framed technology through the framing of it as a technological object. Each response was located within the technological determinism versus social determinism debate and juxtaposed with its place in the technology as utopian or dystopian.\n      </p>", "ith <a

Some problems associated with the study of such religions are addressed in a critical examination of earlier research by Tanya Luhrmann, before attempting to establish how the researcher can enter such a field and undertake effective fieldwork with integrity, without dishonoring the mode of entry (initiation) and the trust of the researched community. Some of the problems which can occur in the study of an initiatory religion such as Wicca, and ways in which these might be mitigated, are briefly explored. The article closes with an assessment of the insider/outsider position suggesting that, rather than being essentially problematic, such a position can in fact be advantageous to the researcher, the research, and the researched community.\n      </p>", "Paganism is one of the fastest-growing religions in the west today. It encompasses a variety of traditions, mostly unified by conceptions of the sacrality of the natural world and the re-embracing of the feminine aspects of the divine. Consequently, both feminism and Nature are central to the discourses of much of contemporary Paganism. This reportback is able to highlight only some of the debates around these features, as they were presented by Pagans at the Parliament of the World's Religions, held this July (2004) in Barcelona, Spain. It also suggests how central these debates are to many critical issues that face our society and espouses their validity in being 'pathways to peace'.\n      </p>", "The fastest growing form of religious identification, spirituality, or \"new\" religious movement in American society over the last decade is Wicca and related forms of \"Neo-Paganism.\" However, with no national organization and minimal local organization, little is known about its distribution across a privatized religious landscape nor about the features of state social and cultural environments that are receptive or contrary to its spread. This study uses Internet data to create estimates of the comparative strength of Wiccan-Pagan identification across the 50 states and conducts multivariate analyses of the ability of variables suggested in prior research to explain its distribution. Not only are the findings consistent with expectations, but differences in correlates of Wicca using the Internet data in contrast to existing measures of \"New Age\" spirituality highlight the empirical importance of maintaining distinctions between the two.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This research continues the discourse on the role of religion in sociopolitical change. Focusing on one of the new religious movements that has attracted feminists, Dianic Wicca, the conditions under which religion promotes rather than inhibits political activism are analyzed. Rates of political participation are high among this group and appear linked to the mediating variable of \"personal efficacy.\" The interpretation is that new religious movements oriented toward transformation of self have the potential for change-oriented politics if they challenge the systemic link of self-evaluations and power.\n      </p>", "This paper looks at the doctrines of 'Wicca', or what might be termed as pagan or white magic by its adherents, in terms of the economics of religion. The primary focus of the paper is the issue of the degree of product differentiation involved from established religion in terms of two things: the concept of God (or deities) and the ideas of sin. The main contribution of the paper is that it presents (for the first time ever, so far as the author is aware) an economic analysis of the doctrine of a 'rebound' effect of any attempts to do harm to other people through the practice of magic. Some basic microeconomic concepts suggest that the moral force of this rebound law is a difficult one to sustain except under very unreasonable assumptions.\n      </p>", "In a recent essay, Dawson (2000) has called for empirical studies of religion in cyberspace. This article contributes one case study toward this larger project, an examination of Kemetic Orthodoxy, an Egyptian revival religion that has developed a following largely through communication on the Internet. Most of the people who become members of Kemetic Orthodoxy learn about this faith, meet other believers, convert and worship online. As Dawson (1998) expects of religions compatible with the Internet, Kemetic Orthodoxy is monistic, tolerant, organizationally open, and experientially oriented, but contrary to his expectations, Kemetic Orthodoxy is based on ritual authority and stresses tradition more than individualism. Like Wicca, Kemetic Orthodoxy is a religion of late modernity.\n      </p>", "           ", "           ", "           ", "The commercialization of witchcraft in various Dutch Fantasy festivals, media and shops, boosted by the success of films, such as Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings, has roused concern on the part of those who see witchcraft as an authentic mystery religion based on initiation. Representatives of different initiatory and hereditary witchcraft traditions were invited to voice their protest at two major fairs in 2003 and 2004. As their positions on 'who is a witch?' clashed with those of self-professed witches in the audience, they struggled to protect witchcraft as a 'trademark' of authenticated traditions. Marking contesting claims to authorship and ownership of as well as authority over the practice of western witchcraft, the different positions simultaneously attested to the normalization of the witchcraft movement as a whole. A proliferation of metaphorical readings of the concepts of witchcraft spurs a confluence of witchcraft and commercial Fantasy fiction.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The paper then examines how and why these various aspects of corporate governance have been changing with processes of economic liberalization currently under way. Finally, it analyzes the consequences of changes in the model of corporate governance for the country's development (e.g. increased consumer goods for middle class consumers, increased disclosure by domestic corporations, less support for corporate social programs, etc.).\n      </p>", "The importance of documenting the plants of Mexico is undeniable considering its status as a country with biological megadiversity on one hand and the accelerated destruction of its ecosystems on the other. Ten years ago we started to compile species lists and literature for the monocotyledons that grow in Mexico, in an attempt to at least partially remedy the current lack of botanical knowledge that exists in the country. Individual electronic databases of nomenclature, bibliography, and herbarium specimens were developed. Currently these databases contain 15,560, 6,700, and 42,000 records, respectively. To date we have registered for the country 4,529 species (or 4,797 taxa including subspecies and varieties) distributed in 619 genera and 60 families (sensu Dahlgren &amp; al., 1985). Of the total number of families, seven include only introduced representatives, whereas the other 53 possess at least some native species. The number of native species is 4,424 (4,693 taxa including subspecies and varieties). A comparison of the data obtained by us together with data reported in various floristic lists of Mexican states, as well as that from some completed regional floras, allows us to obtain statistical estimates that indicate Mexico should possess between 21,300 and 24,601 species of angiosperms. As a final perspective on the importance of the Mexican flora, if the estimate of number of seed plant species in the world is really 223,300 (Scotland &amp; Wortley, 2003), and if we accept the estimate of number of species for Mexico as 24,601, then Mexico would have 11.01 % of the total seed plant species diversity of the entire planet.\n      </p>", "During a revisionary study of Spigelia, three new species from Mexico were discovered.

Presently, it has been estimated that more than 60% of the land area has been severely degraded. Mexico ranks in the top 3 countries in biodiversity, is a plant and faunal dispersal corridor, and is a crucial element in the conservation and management of North American wildlife. Wildlife management prerogatives and regulatory powers reside in the federal government with states relegated a minimum role. The continuous shifting of federal agencies responsible for wildlife management with the concomitant lack of adequate federal funding has not permitted the establishment of a robust wildlife program. In addition, wildlife conservation has been further impacted by a failure to establish landowner incentives, power struggles over user rights, resistance to change, and lack of trust and experience in protecting and managing Mexico's wildlife. We believe future strategies for wildlife programs must take into account Mexico's highly diversified mosaic of ecosystems, cultures, socioeconomic levels, and land tenure and political systems. The private sector, along with communal properties, in cooperation with federal and municipal governments, nongovernmental organizations, corporations, and international agencies may have the greatest potential of sustainable management of Mexico's wildlife. The present federal wildlife management strategy is an initial positive effort because it promotes participatory wildlife conservation by key stakeholders. We identify the aspects of this strategy that we believe will be needed to establish a sustainable program to manage Mexico's wildlife.\n      </p>", "Nectar-feeding bats (tribe Glossophagini) are an important component of the rich chiropteran fauna of Mexico. Because of biological features associated with their specialized diet, nectar-feeding bats might be more vulnerable to extinction than other bats. Twelve species of glossophagines occur in Mexico. Most have restricted distributions, with two species endemic to the country and two species endemic to Middle America. Compared with other neotropical bats, nectar-feeding species are smaller in body mass and have smaller distributions but have similar local densities. In Mexico, most nectar-feeding bats are associated with tropical and subtropical dry areas (tropical deciduous forests and scrubland). Highest species richness occurs along the warm and dry Pacific versant, including the Balsas Basin. Caves are the main roosts of four of the Mexican nectar-feeding bats, and another six species use caves as alternate roosts. Critical faunas analyses performed using three criteria (species richness, presence of rare species, and phylogenetic value) indicated different sets of critical areas for conservation, nonetheless all criteria identified an area of the Pacific versant and lowlands of southeastern Mexico as priority areas for conservation efforts.\n      </p>", "Anthurium faustomirandae sp. nov. is described and illustrated from Chiapas, Mexico.

These people are farmers who live in tight-knit ted, closed communities that dominate their lives. It has been difficult for scholars of religion to understand these cultures because the communities are closed to outsiders and many of the people speak Indian languages.

These children share similar genetic backgrounds, diets, water mineral contents, cultural patterns, and social behaviors. The major difference was their exposure to pesticides. Pesticides have been applied to the agricultural area of the valley since the late 1940s. In 1990, high levels of multiple pesticides were found in the cord blood of newborns and in breast milk. Building on anthropological methods for rapid rural appraisal of problems within the environment, a Rapid Assessment Tool for Preschool Children (RATPC) was developed to measure growth and development. The children of the agrarian region were compared to children living in the foothills, where pesticide use is avoided. The RATPC measured varied aspects of physical growth and abilities to perform, or function in, normal childhood activities. No differences were found in growth patterns. Functionally, the exposed children demonstrated decreases in stamina, gross and fine eye-hand coordination, 30-minute memory, and the ability to draw a person. The RATPC also pointed out areas in which more in-depth research on the toxicology of pesticides would be valuable.\n      </p>", "Many countries, including Mexico, are facing a largely unrecognized epidemic of low-level lead poisoning. Mexico is the sixth largest lead-producing country in the world, and 40% of its production is used locally in different industrial processes that cause lead contamination of the environment. The major sources and pathways of lead exposure among the Mexican population are gasoline emissions, lead-glazed ceramics, leaded paint, and lead in canned foods and beverages. In this paper we present evidence for the presence of lead in different environmental media and its impact on blood lead levels of the Mexican population. Although during the last few years important measures have been implemented to decrease lead exposure, our findings suggest that lead poisoning is still an important problem in Mexico. There is an urgent need for regulatory policies that implement stricter control to protect the Mexican population. There is also a need to develop adequate programs to reduce the lead burden and the associated health effects in the population that has been chronically exposed.\n      </p>", "El Acuerdo de Asociaci\u00f3n Econ\u00f3mica, Concertaci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica y Cooperaci\u00f3n entre M\u00e9xico y la Uni\u00f3n Europea (TLCUE) fue, sin duda, el principal proyecto y logro en materia de pol\u00edtica exterior del gobierno del presidente Zedillo.

This study attempts to understand to what degree labor patterns are affected by the receipt of remittances. Using nationally representative household income and expenditure data for Mexico, I analyze the effect of remittance income on labor supply decisions. I find that household labor supply in response to remittance income is consistent with findings which measure labor supply behavior in the presence of other forms of unearned income in different settings. That is, remittance receipts are associated with fewer hours of work and income elasticities are estimated in the range of -.006 to -.03. This finding attenuates to some degree the measure of the impact of remittances in the receiving country's aggregate output.\n      </p>", "Mexico has long suffered from poverty. Two common government approaches to poverty reduction are public spending for social programs, and public spending for economic competitiveness programs. This article summarizes the nature and effects of these two approaches based on information published in Mexican journals and international research institution reports written in Spanish. Since 1990, public spending for social programs has increased at an annual rate of 7%, whereas spending for economic competitiveness programs has become stagnant. Researchers report that: (1) spending on social programs may not be the primary cause for poverty reduction, (2) social programs may not be reaching those with the greatest need, and (3) social program spending may be causing a decrease in productivity and economic growth. More resources are needed for economic competitiveness programs that increase workforce productivity and well-paid jobs.\n      </p>", "Common property regimes may contribute to environmental conservation and offer a complementary institutional model to state-run protected areas. The potential conservation value of common property management is of particular significance in Mexico, where a large majority of forests are held communally. Systems of common property management often exist in a context of close institutional overlap with state institutions. This project assessed the function of a common property regime nested within Lagunas de Montebello National Park (PNLM) in Chiapas, Mexico. We documented forest status and analyzed common property forest management institutions following severe fires that threatened forest conservation. Forests managed by the common property regime are less intact than federal forests, yet still moderately conserved, and many attributes necessary for common property management are functional, despite the recent fire crisis. Yet external authorities contest common property management by local institutions, resulting in limited joint management by the national park and the community. Formalization and expansion of de facto cooperation between the federal and community institutions may enhance forest conservation within PNLM.\n      </p>", "Townsendia gypsophila, a new species from Sandoval Co., New Mexico, is described and illustrated.

There was a significant correlation between the mean number of latrines and mean number of rabbits sighted within each of four categories of abundance. Spatial distribution was mapped based on these categories of abundance. Mean size of populations of volcano rabbit was estimated at 6,488 individuals (range of 2,478-12,120).

These populations remained isolated from one another for almost 500 years. Morphological studies on fruit characteristics show that coconuts from the two populations are contrasting forms. The Atlantic coast populations show a wild type fruit, with angular shape, thick husk, thick shell, thick endosperm and low water content. The Pacific populations have a domesticated type fruit, with fruit and nut more spherical, with a much thinner husk and shell, and higher water content.

When predicting maquiladora density using percent children and social class in a spatial error regression model, we find that percent children was a positive and significant predictor, while social class was not significant. Adding formal residential development to the model, social class becomes a negative and significant predictor. Formal residential development and percent children are also positive and significant.

Archaeobotanical data are used to consider the shift from extensive to intensive field agriculture as it relates to the development of an agro-forestry system. The data indicate that Formative people increasingly focused maize production in fields located near the residence while simultaneously harvesting more tree fruits through time.

We studied the waterbirds that used this area during the non-breeding season, from September 1996 to March 1997. We surveyed birds on eight occasions from 11 stations that included different combinations of mudflats, water pools, shallow water, deep water, and mangroves.

Gatherers who collect medicinal plants represent the poorest economic link in the trade chain. The critical socioeconomic situation of the human population is reflected in the state of the wild plants at the zone, as a result of an increase in their use for economic survival. The stock of medicinal plants handled by regional traders is an indicator of the abundance and diversity of the flora present in the zone, and permits a dynamic exchange of these products with regional traders from outside.

Most of the medicinal plants marketed and used in Mexico are wild plants. This fact, combined with the increasing demand that exists for medicinal plants in this region, create a potential environmental threat. Since this threat is a multifactorial one, involving the complex socioeconomic conditions in which rural workers and their families live, conservation programs for the wild flora (including reassessed gathering methods, production of selected medicinal species and protection of wild populations and market regulations of quality and equity) have to be applied within an organizational framework of the gatherers and peasants in the zone. / En la cadena de mercadeo de las plantas medicinales secas procedentes del suroccidente del estado de Puebla, M\u00e9xico, los recolectores constituyen el eslab\u00f3n humano m\u00e1s desprotegido.

To this end, the study develops non-traditional indicators for the appropriation of monetary resources related to the positions that individuals from various generations occupy in the home. The comparison of two countries with the largest populations and the highest GDPs in Latin America provides the opportunity for beginning a study of the complex processes of domestic and institutional reproduction developed in each society and the way they are experienced by different generations.\n      </p>", "This paper presents a case study of the relationship between farmers' knowledge of maize varieties and their selection and management of these varieties under conditions of technological change. Research for this paper was done among Spanish-speaking small farmers in an ejido of central Chiapas, Mexico. This ejido is well integrated into the market, and the use of modern technologies is widespread. This research demonstrates that farmers have an extensive and widely shared knowledge of their maize varieties. This knowledge reflects objective maize characteristics. Variation occurs in the farmers' selection and management of maize varieties, but on average the variation deviates from a random pattern in the direction predicted by the farmers' knowledge base. They have incorporated the technological changes brought about by development into their knowledge base. Farmers maintain maize varieties with contrasting traits, and their knowledge base provides important information about which traits and constraints are important to them.\n      </p>", "Quercus tuitensis, a deciduous red oak known only from the Sierra El Tuito on the Pacific slopes of western Jalisco, Mexico, is described, illustrated, and compared to Q. praineana Trel.

It studies the cases of Mexico and Catalunya on the basis of consular and migratory records that have recently been made available. These new sources, with thtir peculiarities and limitations, highlight the contrasts in the socio-demographic profiles of the Argentineans that arrived in Mexico and Catalunya before and after the coup d'\u00e9tat.

People prefer robust, tender plants from the agricultural fields because these \"develop better.\" Hence, the plants are tolerated within the conventional agricultural activities and benefit indirectly from the improvements in the agrohabitat. People do not select individuals with specific morphological characteristics but rather they select for plants at the level of the habitat. This step may precede that of direct management of individual plants. It is possible that these differences in the level of interaction between humans and plants (i.e., within the ruderal and agrestal habitats) may promote morphological and genetic differences over time. /// Anoda cristata es una maleza muy com\u00fan utilizada como medicina y alimento en el centro de M\u00e9xico durante la \u00e9poca de lluvias La gente prefiere las plantas robustas y tiernas que crecen en los campos de cultivo porque se \"desarrollan mejor.\" Ah\u00ed, las plantas son toleradas dentro de las pr\u00e1cticas agr\u00edcolas tradicionales y se benefician indirectamente de las alteraciones que se hacen al agrohabitat.

Fatdepleted birds were more common among the birds that arrived at our study site in southwest Louisiana, though variability characterized our samples. Migrants that landed after encountering opposing winds or rain over the northern Gulf of Mexico were, on average, fatter than migrants that landed when weather was favorable for continued migration. Some of the variation in the energetic condition of arrivals may be explained by the location where migrants initiated crossings. Our simulation of flight over the Gulf of Mexico showed that with following winds a warbler can cross the Gulf of Mexico from Yucatan with fat reserves to spare, and stronger tailwinds make flights from as far south as Honduras energetically permissible. The length of stay after a trans-Gulf flight was related to the extent of fat-depletion upon arrival: lean birds stayed longer than fat migrants. Migrants stopped over for 1-7 days and replenished energy reserves at rates that varied from 0.19 g/d for Hooded Warblers (Wilsonia citrina) to 0.87 g/d for Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus).

Because jaguars are endangered in Mexico, such conflicts have biological, social, and economic consequences. We documented the extent of predation by jaguars and pumas on cattle in 1999-2004 in northeastern Sonora, where the northernmost breeding population of jaguars exists in North America. Jaguars and pumas killed only calves &amp;lt; 12 mo old, and calves constituted 58% of prey biomass consumed by jaguars and 9% by pumas. Annual cause-specific mortality rates of confirmed jaguar predation (\u2264 0.018), confirmed and suspected jaguar predation (\u2264 0.018), and all confirmed and suspected large felid predation (\u2264 0.018) were low and cattle calf survival was high (0.89-0.98 annually). If calves reported as missing but for which no evidence of mortality could be found were classed as large felid predation, annual cause-specific rates increased to 0.006-0.038. Collectively, confirmed jaguar and puma predation accounted for &amp;lt; 14% (57/408) of total cattle losses, with jaguars responsible for 14% of all calf losses; this could increase to a maximum of 36% (146/408) if missing calves were included in the totals. While jaguar and puma predation may have an impact on some small cattle operations, it is generally minor compared to losses from other causes in northeastern Sonora. Moreover, 91% of all confirmed calf kills were associated with three individual jaguars in our study. Targeting problem cats rather than broad-scale predator control may therefore be a viable alternative to address chronic predation problems. Because most (83%) instances of jaguar predation occurred during the dry season along thick riparian habitats, modified cattle husbandry operations, such as establishment of permanent water sources in uplands and away from dense vegetative cover, could ameliorate many cases of predation by jaguars on cattle. /// La predaci\u00f3n por jaguares y pumas es a menudo fuente de conflicto con ganaderos en el Noreste de Sonora, M\u00e9xico.

This paper presents a case study from an ejido in central Chiapas, Mexico, where this pattern is common. Farmers recognize soil types of different quality, embodied in a folk soil taxonomy. They argue that fragmentation is the result of their desire to maintain an equitable distribution of all land types among them, independently of the amount of land each controls. The evidence shows that while not all farmers have all soil types, farmers belonging to all ranges of socieconomic strata control soils in all the soil classes. There is no marked concentration of any soil type by any specific group, types are distributed among farmers by their abundance.

Within the kit-based project, the sample of project teachers is stratified to select teachers with a high number of science PD hours versus those with few hours. While there were no significant differences in the mean total scores for kit-based students with low PD versus high PD teachers, the kit-based classrooms scored significantly higher than students in nonkit classrooms on both the pretest and posttest, though there were significantly more minutes of science instruction in the nonkit classrooms. Finally, nonkit teachers taught more units of shorter length and reported lower levels of preparedness to use reform pedagogical approaches.\n      </p>", "Providing support focused on real challenges is critical in retaining highly qualified new science teachers, but the field lacks a systematic description of these teachers' needs. The authors of this article examine the areas that science teachers are expected to understand: (1) the content and disciplines of science, (2) learners, (3) instruction, (4) learning environments, and (5) professionalism. They review the literature on challenges facing preservice and early-career science teachers, identify issues on which conventional wisdom is supported or called into question, and highlight the areas where the existing research is inadequate as a basis for generalization. For example, the authors found few studies on how new science teachers use curriculum materials or how they understand scientific inquiry. Their overview of challenges is followed by a discussion of how these teachers can be supported.\n      </p>", "Science shops were established at universities throughout the Netherlands in the early 1970s with the avowed aim of democratizing science and contributing to social change. During the past few years, science shops have met with significant challenges. For one thing, they have had to adapt to various changes directly associated with the Dutch political climate, the organization of higher education, national research policies, and so on. Moreover, they have faced serious financial cutbacks. In their efforts to address these challenges, science shops have adopted various approaches, some of which have turned out to be more successful than others. Usually, the differences between the individual Dutch science shops are described and understood only in pragmatic terms, with respect to their internal organization and practices. This article, by contrast, argues that the different ways of coping with change should be understood as reflecting divergent, yet unarticulated, answeres to the question of how science and technology can or should be democratized.\n      </p>", "When scientists act as consultants during the production of a fictional film, it becomes an act of communication that plays a role in the process of science. Fictional film provides a space for scientists to visually model their conceptions of nature. Film impacts scientific practice as science consultants utilize film as a virtual witnessing technology to gather allies among specialists and non-specialists. Film not only has the ability to act as a virtual witnessing technology, but also forces consensus on the public version of scientific debates by presenting a single vision of nature in a perceptually realistic structure. This paper shows films to be successful communicative devices within the scientific community by showing that, and how, other scientists respond to the depictions in the films.

And among the most controversial questions in the early history of the Church is L. Ron Hubbard's involvement in the ritual magic of Aleister Crowley and the possible role of occultism in the development of Scientology. While some critics argue that Crowley's magic lies at the very heart of Scientology, most scholars have dismissed any connection between the Church and occultism. This article examines all of the available historical material, ranging from Hubbard's personal writings, to correspondence between Crowley and his American students, to the first Scientology lectures of the 1950s. Crowley's occult ideas, I argue, do in fact represent one\u2014but only one\u2014element in the rich, eclectic bricolage that became the early Church of Scientology; but these occult elements are also mixed together with themes drawn from Eastern religions, science fiction, pop psychology, and Hubbard's own fertile imagination.\n      </p>", "Objectives: Celebrity followers of the Church of Scientology have recently used their public forum to attack the modern practice of mental health. The practice of Scientology is rooted in the religious writings of its founder, L. Ron Hubbard. This paper will review the religious writings of L Ron Hubbard to understand Scientology's position on mental health. Method: This paper reviews four of the major religious books written by L Ron Hubbard, in addition to a comprehensive overview of Scientology compiled by Scientology staff. Results: Hubbard's theory of mind borrowed heavily from the earlier writings of Freud, until Hubbard's psychological theory extended to include a spiritual existence that goes beyond the material world. The goal of Hubbard's psychology and religion were to optimize the freedom of the individual, and he viewed psychiatry and psychology as inherently anti-spiritual and opposed to personal freedom and self-realization. Ultimately Hubbard presents a world view of potential nuclear world cataclysm, fueled by the geopolitical climate and mental health theories that dominated the mid 20th century. Conclusions: Hubbard's writings mirrored the times in which he lived. His views that mental health practices are inherently anti-religious, freedom-inhibiting, and brain damaging do not reflect the modern-day practices of mental health.\n      </p>", "Scientology, one of the largest and most influential cults, claims to have raised over sixteen thousand members up to a superhuman level of mental functioning known as \"clear.\" This paper presents a theory of how the cult can appear to have succeeded in accomplishing this task. We argue that clear has been transformed from a postulated objective state of being into a well-buttressed social status in the highly stratified social structure of the cult. Four strategies invented by the founder of Scientology encourage members to play the role associated with the clear status: (1) prohibition of indpendent creation and evaluation of clears, (2) development of a hierarchy of statuses below clear, (3) isolation of the preclear at the crucial stage in upward progress, (4) development of a hierarchy of statuses above clear. The Scientology processes supposedly able to make people clear are examples of modern magic-mental and symbolic exercises undertaken to accomplish the impossible-and therefore are highly subject to empirical disconfirmation. Despite the momemtary success of the cult's strategies to protect its magic, we suggest that Scientology may be forced to evolve more fully into a true religion that promises supernatural rewards which only can be obtained in a world beyond the senses.\n      </p>", "In an attempt to discover the effects of long-term membership in scientology, 48 members were administered a series of personality measures, including the Adjective Check List, the Purpose in Life Test, and the Barron Ego-Strength scale of the MMPI. Semantic differentials seeking responses on the respondent's situation prior to joining Scientology and demographic data were also administered. Results of correlations (partialled for age) between personality measures and time in the movement suggest that there was a significant increase in social ease and in effectiveness of goal-directed behavior. Data also indicated that members were unlikely to have been unhappy or unstable prior to joining. These findings suggest that the negative aspects reported by some authors of membership in Scientology are not apparent in this sample, and that there may be some benefits accrued to long-term members. Further longitudinal studies are required to confirm these data.\n      </p>", "Cet article analyse la fabrication d'un nouveau culte am\u00e9ricain, la Scientologie.

This article analyses the making of a new American cult, Scientology. It traces the evolution of the founder, Hubbard, from his handbook Dianetics to the Church of Scientology, and shows how he blended various religious and cultural trends into the doctrine. The ideology thus elaborated is found to be in keeping with that of American society at large that the adepts are trained to dominate through self-improvement techniques. The conclusion is that Hubbard created a cult within the tradition of American religions which by sacralizing secular ideals aim at helping man in his conquest of the world.\n      </p>", "Das BAG bejaht den arbeitsgerichtlichen Rechtsweg f\u00fcr Streitigkeiten von Arbeitnehmern der Scientology Kirche e.

A hypothetical case shows how each stage is treated through specific intervention formula designed to reverse the process. \u201cEthics\u201d is shown to closely parallel symbolic interactionist theories of deviance. Its differences from symbolic interactionism are ascribed to the inherent contradiction between the individualistic and system-centered orientations permeating American capitalist society.\n      </p>", "The interaction between social movements and countermovements is a key aspect of resource mobilization theory, yet researchers have devoted comparatively little study to it. This article uses the conflict between Scientology and its Internet critics as a case study in movement/countermovement interaction, concentrating on resource deprivation and damaging actions. The uniqueness of Internet communication, however, requires adjustments to traditional resource mobilization theory in order to theorize this conflict, and this article proposes two refinements. First, the study of Internet movement/countermovement interaction involves the displacement of the normally-central role of the state in resource mobilization theory. Second, a rethinking of the definition of resources to include \"virtual\" resources facilitates movement/countermovement analysis on the Internet. /// L'interaction entre les movements sociaux et les contre-mouvements est au fondement m\u00eame de la th\u00e9orie sur la mobilisation des ressources, pourtant les chercheur-e-s y consacrent relativement peu d'attention.

Remarkably, however, it has rarely been subjected to serious, critical study by historians of religions, in large part because of the intense secrecy that has surrounded the movement from its origins. This paper examines the role of secrecy in the early Church of Scientology, placing it in the historical and cultural context in which it emerged: Cold War America of the 1950s and 60s. Far from a strange aberration, Scientology in fact embodies many of the obsessive concerns with secrecy, information-control, and surveillance that ran throughout Cold War America. Indeed, with its policies of \"security checks\" and \"fair game,\" Scientology developed an apparatus of secrecy and surveillance that rivaled and in fact mirrored that of the FBI.

It argues that the concept of verfassungsfeindlich (hostile to the constitution), which according to Hexham and Poewe is central in German anticult rhetoric, is used only against Scientology, and it does not play any significant role in other cases. The anticult climate in German public and government reactions to minority religions does not appear to be more intense than in many other European countries. It is not convincing, therefore, to explain them with specific German historical experiences. However, religion does hold a lower position on the scale of constitutional rights than in the United States. Freedom of religion may not impinge upon other constitutional rights. Government involvement in anticult activities does not seem to be due to shortcomings of the political or legal system. Rather it reflects deficiencies in actual policy-making and in particular lack of reliable information about new religious movements.\n      </p>", "The development of a concept of \"cult\" useful for empirical research has lagged behind the refinement of terms used to analyze other forms of religious organization. Utilizing Troeltsch's \"technical mysticism\" concept, the article defines cults as non-traditional religious groups that are based on a belief in a divine element within the individual. Three ideal types of cults are posited: a mystically-oriented illumination type; an instrumental type, in which inner experience is sought for its effects; and a service-oriented type, which is focused on aiding others. The usefulness of the typology is tested in its application to the analysis of six groups: Theosophy, Wisdom of the Soul, Spiritualism, New Thought, Scientology, and Transcendental Meditation.\n      </p>", "Under the artistic direction of Alex Timbers, Les Freres Corbusier has carved out a niche for itself as a purveyor of an anarchic, hyper-literate variety of what Timbers calls post-ironic theatre, an \"aggressively visceral theatre combining historical revisionism, multimedia excess, found texts, sophomoric humor, and rigorous academic research.\"\n      </p>", "Sociologists of religion interested in the possible cultural significance of contemporary new religious movements have tended to focus their analyses on whether these new forms of religious life are or are not agents of modernization and/or secularization.

Robertson's theory, it is argued, helps to undermine the questionable tendency to identify new religions as either modern or antimodern, secularizing or desecularizing. But it tends to erroneously limit the attribution of cultural significance to movements of religious fundamentalism or renewed orthodoxy.

Ron Hubbard, La dian\u00e9tique: la science moderne de la sant\u00e9 mentale (1950), traite d'une forme populaire et peu orthodoxe de th\u00e9rapie psychologique qui pr\u00e9tend r\u00e9soudre les probl\u00e8mes personnels et conduire \u00e0 une existence prot\u00e9g\u00e9e et r\u00e9ussie au plan social. Hubbard est le fondateur de l'Eglise de scientologie, un des cultes les plus en vue de la culture populaire am\u00e9ricaine des ann\u00e9es 70 et il sut en devenir le porte-parole c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, reconnu bien que myst\u00e9rieux. A ses d\u00e9buts, Hubbard \u00e9crivait de la science-fiction \u00e0 bon march\u00e9 pour Astounding Science Fiction de John Campbell et la dian\u00e9tique puise certaines racines dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat traditionnel que ce genre romanesque porte \u00e0 la psychologie en tant que base d'une technique efficace parodiant ainsi l'id\u00e9e que la science-fiction se fait du r\u00f4le des sciences physiques. Particuli\u00e8rement pendant les ann\u00e9es 50, on put s'apercevoir de l'importance de ces racines quand de nombreux \u00e9crivains, dont Campbell, furent attir\u00e9s par les id\u00e9es de Hubbard. Depuis les ann\u00e9es 20, une \"science de l'esprit\" \u00e9tait une notion de base de la science-fiction; E.E. (\"Doc\") Smith avait con\u00e7u des astronefs et des armes actionn\u00e9s par la pens\u00e9e et avant l'av\u00e8nement du nucl\u00e9aire, Campbell exposa ses id\u00e9es sur le sujet dans plusieurs r\u00e9cits et dans de nombreux articles de fond. D'apr\u00e8s Campbell, les \"science mentales\" pouvaient s'\u00e9tendre de la m\u00e9decine psychosomatique \u00e0 la t\u00e9l\u00e9pathie, agissant en partie comme antidote aux probl\u00e8mes suscit\u00e9s par la technologie. Mais, d'une mani\u00e8re significative, ces sciences correspondaient \u00e0 des syst\u00e8mes avanc\u00e9s de connaissance pouvant \u00eatre appr\u00e9hend\u00e9s uniquement sous forme de magie. Il est \u00e9galement r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur que Campbell ait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les anciens pr\u00eatres et devins comme des praticiens de \"la science de la magie\"; de plus, il a d\u00e9crit la science moderne comme de \"la magie qui fonctionne\". Au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 40, des \u00e9crivains comme Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov et A.E. van Vogt collaboraient \u00e0 la revue de Campbell. Certaines techniques psychologiques utilis\u00e9es devinrent parties int\u00e9grantes des th\u00e9ories de l'histoire que ces auteurs incorporaient \u00e0 leurs r\u00e9cits. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, ils pensaient que ces techniques \u00e9clipseraient l'\u00e9conomie, la politique et les autres forces consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme les causes d\u00e9terminantes des relations sociales caract\u00e9risant les civilisations. De tels concepts leur parurent plus importants apr\u00e8s l'av\u00e8nement du nucl\u00e9aire. Avant la cr\u00e9ation de la dian\u00e9tique, la fiction de Hubbard peut se lire comme une critique fonci\u00e8rement d\u00e9tach\u00e9e de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 industrielle et de la faillite de la vie politique qui l'accompagne; c'est \u00e9galement un expos\u00e9 du r\u00e9jet de cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et de cette vie politique effectu\u00e9 par une certaine \u00e9lite. Au m\u00eame moment, et en dehors de la science-fiction, de telles id\u00e9es circulaient dans d'autres secteurs de la culture am\u00e9ricaine. La psychoth\u00e9rapie avait recours \u00e0 la psychochirurgie et aux drogues et les vis\u00e9es bureaucratiques, techniques et gestionnaires supplantaient les id\u00e9aux sociaux et politiques. En insistant sur le pouvoir individuel et personnel assist\u00e9 de la th\u00e9rapeutique et sur l'\u00e9limination de l'irrationnel et du mal, la dian\u00e9tique s'ins\u00e8re naturellement dans ce contexte historique. De plus, Hubbard soutenait que, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la dian\u00e9tique, l'espace pouvait devenir un nouveau champ de d\u00e9ploiement de la mythologie am\u00e9ricaine; du moins pour ceux et celles qui terminaient leur cours de th\u00e9rapie et qui se d\u00e9barrassaient ainsi de toutes leurs n\u00e9vroses. Dans l'intervalle, d'autres \u00e9crivains dont Cyril Kornbluth et Robert Bloch s'aper\u00e7urent des limites d'une telle vision du monde appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 la fois \u00e0 la critique politique et sociale de la science-fiction ainsi qu'\u00e0 la pens\u00e9e et \u00e0 l'action sociales. De tels concepts pouvaient justifier l'apathie et ainsi perp\u00e9tuer la tyrannie. /// L. Ron Hubbard's widely advertised book, Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health (1950), describes a popular form of unorthodox psychological \"therapy\" that purports to offer solutions to personal problems and to point the way to a secure and socially successful life. The Church of Scientology that he founded became one of the more prominent \"cults\" characterizing American popular culture during the 1970s, and he himself became a famous, if notorious and mysterious, figure as its leader. Yet Hubbard started out as a pulp SF writer in John Campbell's Astounding Science Fiction, and Dianetics has substantial roots in SF's traditional interest in the use of psychological science as the basis for a powerful technology mimicking the genre's ideas on the role of the physical sciences. The extent of these roots was seen in the 1950s when many SF writers-Campbell among them-were initially attracted to Hubbard's ideas. A \"science of the mind\" had been a staple in SF at least since the 1920s, when E.E. (\"Doc\") Smith had written of thought-powered spaceships and weapons, and Campbell himself had included his ideas on the subject in some of his fictions and many of his editorials even before the achievement of nuclear power. From Campbell's perspective, \"mental sciences\" might mean anything from psychosomatic medicine to telepathy, partially as an antidote for the problems created by the use of physical technology, but more significantly as advanced systems of knowledge not yet fully understood, except as various forms of magic. Equally significantly, Campbell wrote of his respect for ancient priests and soothsayers as practitioners of \"the Science of Magic,\" and he would later describe modern science as \"The Magic that Works.\" During the early 1940s, writers publishing in Campbell's magazine (e.g., Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, and A.E. van Vogt) made a variety of psychological technologies integral parts of the theories of history incorporated in their stories. In general, all of them imagined that these technologies would eventually displace economics, politics, and other forces as the principal determinants of social relationships in human civilizations. Such concepts seemed more important to them after the achievement of nuclear power. The fiction Hubbard wrote before he created Dianetics can be read as a severely alienated critique of modern industrial society and the failure of the political life associated with it, as well as a brief for the abandonment of both by an elite. Such concepts appeared outside the orbit of SF in American culture at the same time-viz., during the years in which psychosurgery and the use of drugs were becoming increasingly characteristic of orthodox psychotherapy and in which bureaucratic, technical, and managerial objectives were increasingly being substituted for social and political ideals. Dianetics' emphasis on individual, personal empowerment through therapy and on the elimination of irrationality and evil thus fit very nicely into that historical context. Moreover, Hubbard explicitly stated that Dianetics would permit the extension of the frontier of American mythology into outer space, at least for those who completed the course of therapy and were \"cleared\" of all their neuroses.

It extends on the basic approach of Artemov's logic of proofs (Artemov 1994), representing an epistemic logic based on dependent justifications, where the definition of information relies on a strict distinction from factual truth. The definition obtained by comparison with a Normal Modal Logic translates a constructive logic for \"becoming informed\": its distinction from the logic of \"being informed\"\u2014which internalizes truthfulness\u2014is essential to a general evaluation of information with respect to truth.

Some of these frameworks focus on the dynamics of the interpretation process, some on the dynamics of the process of drawing inferences, and some do both of these. Formalisms galore, so it is felt that some conceptual streamlining would pay off. This paper is part of a larger scale enterprise to pursue the obvious parallel between information processing and imperative programming. We demonstrate that logical tools from theoretical computer science are relevant for the logic of information flow. More specifically, we show that the perspective of bare logic [13, 18] can fruitfully be applied to the conceptual simplification of information flow logics. Part one of this program consisted of the analysis of 'dynamic interpretation' in this way, using the example of dynamic predicate logic [10]; the results were published in [7]. The present paper constitutes the second part of the program, the analysis of 'dynamic inference'. Here we focus on Veltman\u2019s update logic [22]. Update logic is an example of a logical framework which takes the dynamics of drawing inferences into account by modelling information growth as discarding of possibilities. This paper shows how information logics like update logic can fruitfully be studied by linking their dynamic principles to static 'correctness descriptions'. Our theme is exemplified by providing a sound and complete HoarelPratt style deduction system for update logic. The Hoare/Pratt correctness statements use modal propositional dynamic logic as assertion language and connect update logic to the modal propositional logic S5. The connection with S5 provides a clear link between the dynamic and the static semantics of update logic. The fact that update logic is decidable was noted already in [2]; the connection with S5 provides an alternative proof. The S5 connection can also be used for rephrasing the validity notions of update logic and for performing consistency checks. In conclusion, it is argued that interpreting the dynamic statements of information logics as dynamic modal operators has much wider applicability. In fact, the method can be used to axiomatize quite a wide range of information logics.\n      </p>", "This essay attempts to implement epistemic logic through a non-classical inference relation.

Then in a Hilbert space \u223c turns out to express orthocomplementation. This can be extended to any logical space, which makes it possible to define the dimension of a logical space. The received Birkhoff and von Neumann \"quantum logic\" can be interpreted by taking their \"disjunction\" to be \u00ac(\u223cA &amp; \u223c B).

The latter is characterized by two key features. First, the truth values of logical propositions span a set of linguistic terms such as true, very true, almost false, very false, and false. Second, the logic allows logical categories to overlap in contrast to Boolean logic, where the two possible logical categories, \"true\" and \"false,\" are sharply distinct. A game becomes a linguistic fuzzy logic game by turning strategies into linguistic fuzzy strategies, players' preferences into linguistic fuzzy preferences, and the rules of reasoning and inferences of the game into linguistic fuzzy reasoning operating according to linguistic fuzzy logic.

L'interpr\u00e9tation repose sur le recours \u00e0 la notion de sacr\u00e9, et les approches constructivistes et ph\u00e9nom\u00e9nologiques du corps. Pour devenir un \u00ab vrai \u00bb bodybuilder, le pratiquant sacralise en effet son identit\u00e9 en respectant certaines r\u00e8gles de puret\u00e9.

Becoming a \u00ab true \u00bb bodybuilder implies regarding one's identity as sacred by observing certain rules of purity. Moreover, this morally \u00ab clean \u00bb lifestyle brings about a deep satisfaction insofar as it enables the bodybuilder to discover his/her \u00ab inside \u00bb social sphere. Following Michel Maffesoli's views the authorin shows that in bodybuilding narcissism, individualism and loneliness are paradoxically mingled with their opposite : the collective body. They define the shared style of a subculture of which they are the centre. Die Autorin analysiert das \u00ab extreme \u00bb Bodybuilding als die Quelle einer wichtigen Arbeit auf sich selbst und beschreibt dessen gymnastische Normen. Ihre Interpretation gr\u00fcndet sich auf den Begriff des Heiligen und auf konstruktivistische und ph\u00e4nomenologische Ann\u00e4herungen an dem K\u00f6rper. Um ein echter Bodybuilder zu werden, soll man seine Identit\u00e4t als heilig verehren, indem man gewisse Reinheitsregeln befolgt. \u00dcberdies ist diese Lebensart moralisch \u00ab rein \u00bb und sie verschafft dem Bodybuilder eine tiefe Zufriedenheit insoweit, als sie ihm seine \u00ab innere soziale Sphere \u00bb endecken l\u00e4sst. Michel Maffesolis Theorien folgend zeigt die Autorin, dass sich im Bodybuilding Narzissmus, Individualismus und Einsamkeit paradoxerweise mit ihrem Gegenteil, dem kollektiven K\u00f6rper, vermischen. Sie bestimmen eine geteilte Art Subkultur in deren Zentrum sie stehen.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Blood substitutes are under development for transfusion in place of donor blood during emergencies and lengthy surgeries.

These dragonflies approximately double their body mass during adult maturation. This is due primarily to growth of flight muscle in males and growth of ovaries in females. Males attain one of the highest FMRs of any animal; up to 60% of their body mass is flight muscle. During observations of relative mating success among groups of two to five individually marked males, there was a significant decline in mating success with decreasing FMR rank. Relative mating success was measured by the proportion of total daily oviposition time spent by females mated last by each male. Males that had their FMRs reduced experimentally by attachment of small weights had poor territorial and mating success when they were competing with unweighted males. These results suggest that a high FMR enhances ability to compete in aerial contests, which enables greater short-term mating success. Mature males with the highest FMRs had the least gut contents and fat reserves; thus, there is a trade-off made between flight ability and nutritional state that may affect longevity and long-term mating success. A trade-off between benefits derived from enhanced flight performance and costs incurred by reducing the mass of tissues other than flight muscle is probably widespread among flying animals.\n      </p>", "A number of research groups are developing electrical implants that can be attached directly to the retina in an attempt to restore vision to patients suffering from retinal degeneration.

The effect of boron supplementation was investigated in male bodybuilders. Ten male bodybuilders (aged 20 to 26) were given a 2.5-mg boron supplement, while nine male bodybuilders (aged 21 to 27) were given a placebo for 7 weeks. Plasma total and free testosterone, plasma boron, lean body mass, and strength measurements were determined on day 1 and day 49 of the study. A microwave digestion procedure followed by inductively coupled argon plasma spectroscopy was used for boron determination. Twelve subjects had boron values at or above the detection limit with median value of 25 ng/ml (16 ng/ml lower quartile and 33 ng/ml upper quartile). Of the ten subjects receiving boron supplements, six had an increase in their plasma boron. Analysis of variance indicated no significant effect of boron supplementation on any of the other dependent variables. Both groups demonstrated significant increases in total testosterone (p&lt;0.01), lean body mass (p&lt;0.01), and one repetition maximum (RM) squat (p&lt;0.001) and one RM bench press (p&lt;0.01).

The attitudes of media presenters, journalists and public figures from all walks of community and political life demonstrate a lack of gender awareness, prejudices, limited knowledge of both the history and the current achievements of the female movement, as well as of its intents and objectives, and their disparaging of female emancipation and feminism borders on mockery. The sample of media statements the author has collected within the past four years testifies to the gender-incorrectness encountered in speech; both in the stock of words and in the stock of phrases such patriarchal expressions like 'man the hunter', sexist terms like 'sexual harassment', or negatively loaded words like 'feminist' are quite common. Questions like, \"Is bodybuilding good for women?\", are instrumental in ingraining the traditionally split perception of male/female roles. An obviously conservative attitude to male and female qualities taints personal statements, opinions expressed in interviews, and entire TV/radio programmes. Starting in the late 1960s feminist linguistics began justifiably to criticise the sexist use of language. In continuation of feminist linguistics the post-feminist period has introduced gender linguistics. Speech, and communication through speech are the kinds of social behaviour that may generate role stereotypes, or, conversely, when properly gender sensitive, they may play a decisive role in suppressing these stereotypes, thus contributing to the equal chances of both sexes.\n      </p>", "           ", "           ", "           ", "Because the female bodybuilder in \"Pumping Iron II: The Women\" is constituted by being posed, she is the subject par excellence.

A comparison of the Duckworth/Lewis model with several years of data from international matches is made that confirms the suitability of the underpinning model, but the data indicate that there is a need to update the model's parameters. An upgrading of the model is suggested to cope with high-scoring matches when the basic model's assumptions begin to break down. Although the price of the enhanced model is loss of simplicity and complete reliance on software, cricketing authorities have begun to believe the price to be worth paying. Data from actual matches are used throughout to illustrate the implementation of this successful use of Operational Research principles to the solution of a practical problem in one-day cricket.\n      </p>", "Multiple linear regression techniques are applied to determine the relative batting and bowling strengths and a common home advantage for teams playing both innings of international one-day cricket and the first innings of a test-match. It is established that in both forms of the game Australia and South Africa were rated substantially above the other teams. It is also shown that home teams generally enjoyed a significant advantage. Using the relative batting and bowling strengths of teams, together with parameters that are associated with common home advantage, winning the toss and the establishment of a first-innings lead, multinomial logistic regression techniques are applied to explore further how these factors critically affect outcomes of test-matches. It is established that in test cricket a team's first-innings batting and bowling strength, first-innings lead, batting order and home advantage are strong predictors of a winning match outcome. Contrary to popular opinion, it is found that the team batting second in a test enjoys a significant advantage. Notably, the relative superiority of teams during the fourth innings of a test-match, but not the third innings, is a strong predictor of a winning outcome. There is no evidence to suggest that teams generally gained a winning advantage as a result of winning the toss.\n      </p>", "The tradition of tossing a coin to decide who bats first in a cricket match introduces a randomly assigned advantage to one team that is unique in sporting contests. The potential importance of the toss rule in determining cricket match results has been the subject of some investigation, which is further advanced in this paper that utilizes a data set relating to the increasingly popular, but contentious, day-night form of limited overs cricket as played at international level. We employ logit regression models to examine the effects of winning the toss and choice of batting order on the likelihood of a match victory, while controlling for home advantage and (relative) team quality. Our findings suggest that winning the toss and batting first increases the probability of winning whereas winning the toss and bowling first does not.\n      </p>", "Exposure to anthropogenic endocrine disruptors has been listed as one of several potential causes of amphibian declines in recent years.

Compared with the preorganochlorine era studied (1852-1929), the percentage of intersex cricket frogs increased during the period of industrial growth and initial uses of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (1930-1945), was highest during the greatest manufacture and use of p,p-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and PCBs (1946-1959), began declining with the increase in public concern and environmental regulations that reduced and then prevented sales of DDT in the United States (1960-1979), and continued to decline through the period of gradual reductions in environmental residues of organochlorine pesticides and PCBs in the midwestern United States (1980-2001). The proportion of intersex individuals among those frogs was highest in the heavily industrialized and urbanized northeastern portion of Illinois, intermediate in the intensively farmed central and northwestern areas, and lowest in the less intensively managed and ecologically more diverse southern part of the state. Records of deposits of cricket frog specimens into museum collections indicate a marked reduction in numbers from northeastern Illinois in recent decades. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that endocrine disruption contributed to the decline of cricket frogs in Illinois.\n      </p>", "The batting average statistic has been used almost exclusively to assess the worth of a batsman. It reveals a great deal about the potential performance of batsmen in cricket played at the first class level. However, in the one-day game, strict limits on the number of balls bowled have introduced a very important additional dimension to performance. In the one-day game, it is clearly not good enough for a batsman to achieve a high batting average with a low strike rate. Runs scored slowly, even without the loss of wickets, will generally result in defeat rather than victory in the one-day game. Assessing batting performance in the one-day game, therefore, requires the application of at least a two-dimensional measurement approach because of the time dimension imposed on limited overs cricket. In this paper, we use a new graphical representation with Strike rate on one axis and the Probability of getting out on the other, akin to the risk-return framework used in portfolio analysis, to obtain useful, direct and comparative insights into batting performance, particularly in the context of the one-day game. Within this two-dimensional framework we develop a selection criterion for batsmen, which combines the average and the strike rate. As an example of the application, we apply this criterion to the batting performances of the 2003 World Cup. We demonstrate the strong and consistent performances of the Australian and Indian batsmen as well as provide a ranking of batting prowess for the top 20 run scorers in the tournament.\n      </p>", "Discrete state series can often be modelled by stationary Markov chains. However, if the Markov chain depends on the value of an additional variable, then it may be necessary to fit a set of interconnected Markov chains. This paper shows how this can be done using log-linear modelling. The methods are exemplified by modelling the human alpha-fetoprotein DNA sequence and the results of Australia versus England test cricket matches. In the former case, the additional variable is reading frame position and in the latter it is the country in which the match is played. Practical problems such as the power of the tests and the effect of cells with small expected values are discussed.\n      </p>", "This paper describes the scheduling of the matches for the 1992 World Cup of Cricket using a heuristic method programmed in Lotus 1-2-3.

It is recognized, within the game of cricket, that such measures have severe limitations in assessing the true performances and abilities of players. Whenever a player's performance statistics are quoted, there is nearly always some verbal qualification that is necessary in order to place the statistics into context. Such comments include the stage of an innings a player usually bats or bowls, as this significantly affects a player's opportunity for scoring runs or taking wickets. Further, traditional measures do not allow the comparison of the skills of batting and bowling as they are based on incompatible scales. This paper uses the well-established Duckworth/Lewis methodology to create alternative measures of player performance. These measures, it is argued, have the potential to reflect better the performances of players having regard for the stages of innings that runs are scored or conceded and wickets taken or lost. The proposed measures could impact in evaluating player performance for a particular match, a series of matches, or in the longer term over players' careers. Further, the methodology enables an objective measure to be created that compares and combines the performances of batsmen and bowlers and of a player's all-round ability. Data from international matches are used to illustrate the methodology and how it compares with existing measures.\n      </p>", "The paper discusses the properties of a rule for adjusting scores in limited overs cricket matches to preserve probabilities of victory across interruptions by rain. Such a rule is argued to be attractive on grounds of fairness, intelligibility and tactical neutrality. A comparison with other rules also offers a useful way of assessing the way in which the application of such rules will affect the fortunes of teams in rain-affected games. Simulations based on an estimated parameterization of hazards of dismissal and on numerical dynamic programming methods are used to compare a probability preserving rule with the now widely used Duckworth-Lewis method.\n      </p>", "Herpetologists are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of hematological parameters for evaluating the welfare of their study animals. In particular, differential counts of white blood cells (from blood smears) are now commonly performed on amphibians, although interpretation of such counts relies on some knowledge of the normal range for the species in question, and for many species this range is not known. In this study we examined blood smears from 79 cricket frogs (Acris c. crepitans) from two ponds in northeastern Georgia to establish reference ranges of white blood cell differentials for this species and to explore possible differences in relative white blood cell numbers between sexes, ponds, and body sizes. For comparison, we also compiled values of many other amphibians from published and unpublished records. We found that lymphocytes made up the majority (68.3%) of white blood cells in cricket frogs, followed by neutrophils (22.4%). There was no difference in relative cell numbers of any type between sexes, nor was there an association with body size. Relative numbers of certain cell types (lymphocytes and neutrophils) varied between ponds. In general the values for cricket frogs resembled those of other amphibians, with high numbers of lymphocytes and neutrophils and low numbers of eosinophils, basophils and monocytes. However, in assembling the records for other species we discovered that all Ambystomatid salamanders examined thus far have markedly elevated values of eosinophils compared to other amphibian species. Moreover, their eosinophil counts may be the highest of all vertebrates, and clearly warrant further study to determine their significance.\n      </p>", "In cricket, a rain-affected pitch can make batting more difficult than normal. Several other conditions such as poor light or an initially lively pitch, may also result in difficulties for the batsmen. In this note, we refer to all of them as 'sticky wickets'. On sticky wickets, lower order batsmen are often sent into 'hold the fort' until conditions improve. In this paper, a stochastic dynamic programming model is used to examine the appropriateness of this policy. The model suggests that the tactic is often optimal when the sticky wicket persists until the end of the day's play, but not often when the sticky wicket is transitory. In some circumstances, it is worthwhile, on a normal wicket near the end of the day, to send in a lower order batsman to hold the fort (a night watchman): when the wicket is sticky, this tactic is even more worthwhile.\n      </p>", "The author's previous paper on this topic showed that the Duckworth/Lewis methodology has considerable potential for providing relevant and objective measures of performance in one-day cricket. The present paper evaluates how these measures can apply in the longer term. This assessment is based upon several series of matches involving the main players from most of the major cricketing nations. Although data used are not exhaustive, they are of sufficient quantity to provide strong indications of the long-term viability of the measures, thus leading to the realistic expectation of inclusion of the methodology into the existing player-rankings or the development of an independent set of performance indicators that reflect more validly the value of players' inputs to matches. Such measures are expected to be of valuable use to team management, media commentators and to the public.\n      </p>", "The paper attempts to understand batting strategies that are employed in limited overs cricket games. The question of the optimum batting strategy is posed in a simplified dynamic programming representation. We demonstrate that optimum strategies may be expected to differ fundamentally in the first and second innings, typically involving an increasing run rate when setting a target but a run rate which may decline over the course of an innings when chasing one. Data on English county level limited overs games are used to estimate a model of actual batting behaviour. The statistical framework takes the form of an interesting variant on conventional survival analysis models.\n      </p>", "In cricket, when a batsman is dismissed towards the end of a day's play, he is often replaced by a lower-order batsman (a 'night watchman'), in the hope that the remaining recognised batsmen can start their innings on the following day. A dynamic programming analysis suggests that the common practice of using a lower-order batsman is often sub-optimal. Towards the end of a day's play, when the conventional wisdom seems to be to use a night watchman, it may be best to send in the next recognised batsman in the batting order. Sending in a night watchman may be good judgement when there are several recognised batsman and several lower order batsmen still to play (say four of each). However, with smaller numbers (two of each, for example), then, with very few overs left to play, it may be better to send in a recognised batsman.\n      </p>", "Left-handers occur at unexpectedly high frequencies at top levels of many interactive sports. This may occur either because left-handed contestants are innately superior or because they enjoy a negatively frequency-dependent strategic advantage when rare relative to right-handers. We analysed the batting records from the 2003 cricket World Cup and showed that left-handed batsmen were more successful than right-handers, and that the most successful teams had close to 50% left-handed batsmen. We demonstrate that this was because left-handed batsmen have a strategic advantage over bowlers, and that this advantage is greatest over bowlers that are unaccustomed to bowling to left-handers. This provides a clear mechanism for negative frequency-dependent success of left-handed batsmen. Our results may also support a historical role for negative frequency-dependent success in fights and other contests in the maintenance of left-handedness by natural selection.\n      </p>", "This paper concerns a computer system which has been devised to timetable the county cricket matches in England.

In this paper we show that the traditional batting average depends on an unrealistic parametric assumption. We propose a nonparametric approach based on runs scored for assessing batting performance.

The statistical methodology employed is akin to that used in reliability and survival analysis.\n      </p>", "Luck can play a big part in tournament success, and progress is not necessarily the best measure of performance. A linear model is used to fit least squares ratings to margins of victory in the cricket World Cup. The Duckworth/Lewis rain interruption rules are used to project a winning second innings score and create a margin of victory in runs, equivalent to that used when the team batting first wins. Results show that, while the better teams progressed through the first round of the competition, some injustices occurred in the Super-Six round. This appears to be due to the double counting of selected matches. Ordering teams by average margin of victory gives similar results to the more complicated linear model, and its use as a tie breaker is suggested. Publication of the margin of victory as estimated by the Duckworth/Lewis method for second innings victories in all one-day matches would provide a common margin of victory suitable for analysis.\n      </p>", "In cricket, particularly near the end of an innings, batsmen of different abilities need to manage the rate at which they score runs. Either batsman can choose to bat aggressively or defensively, which alters their chances of scoring runs or being dismissed. Since they change ends when they score a run and at the end of an over, by scoring an odd or even number of runs the two batsmen also determine which of them will face the next ball. It may be worthwhile to refuse a run to keep the slower or lower scoring batsman from the strike. Some dynamic programming models are developed which could be used to maximise the total number of runs scored.\n      </p>", "Cricket requires a continuity of performance by one team in batting until a violation of the playing rules is encountered. That violation-causing a binary decision, the possible dismissal of a batsman-may have a significant effect on the course of the batting side, and ultimately on the game. Some dismissals are indisputable, but a significant minority are the subject of decisions by umpires. Some of these are complex situations yet need rapid decision-making, and television slow-motion replays have highlighted the problem of apparent misjudgments. The effect of such decisions on batsmen and on innings totals can be simulated and consequently estimated to assess their importance.\n      </p>", "The proportions of dismissals which were leg before wicket in test cricket matches during 1978-2004 are analysed by using generalized linear and mixed models to assess the effect of location, team and the presence or otherwise of neutral umpires. The location and the team batting are clearly significant. There is also clear evidence of an interaction showing that some teams' players are out leg before wicket less often at home but there is no further interaction with neutral umpires, suggesting that this is not caused simply by home umpires favouring the home team.\n      </p>", "A method is described for setting revised target scores for the team batting second when a limited-overs cricket match has been forcibly shortened after it has commenced. It is designed so that neither team benefits or suffers from the shortening of the game and so is totally fair to both. It is easy to apply, requring nothing more than a single table of numbers and a pocket calculator, and is capable of dealing with any number of interruptions at any stage of either or both innings. The method is based on a simple model involving a two-factor relationship giving the number of runs which can be scored on average in the remainder of an innings as a function of the number of overs remaining and the number of wickets fallen. It is shown how the relationship enables the target score in an interrupted match to be recalculated to reflect the relative run scoring resources available to the two teams, that is overs and wickets in combination. The method was used in several international and domestic one-day competitions and tournaments in 1997.\n      </p>", "Endecous betariensis, a new species of cricket collected in a limestone cave from the Ribeira Valley Speleological Province, state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, is described and its calling song characterized.

The role of developmental temperature in shaping female preference functions, and thus its influence on signal-preference coupling has not been investigated. In this study, the effects of developmental temperature are examined in both males and females of the Hawaiian cricket, Laupala cerasina, to determine the degree of signal-preference matching between male song and female preference due to developmental environment. We found that rearing females in different temperature environments affected adult female acoustic preference functions in the same direction as male calling song, thereby influencing variation in adult reproductive behavior in such a way that male and female components remain coordinated. However, we further demonstrate that for male song, the effect of the rearing environment is not permanent but appears only to exert influence for a period of days. This mid-term temperature effect is distinct from the effect of short-term ambient temperature, which influences song in a matter of minutes and has been well documented. Signal-preference coordination, and sexual selection pressures due to mismatching within natural populations, likely will be influenced by nymphal developmental environments of males and females, as well as by adult singing and preference environments.\n      </p>", "Larviparous female tachinid flies are attracted to taped cricket songs. In the laboratory flies deposit larvae on a cricket mounted to a speaker; the larvae burrow through the cricket's exoskeleton and develop internally.

In particular, series played in Australia have drawn much criticism from individual players in visiting teams, as well as from the general public both in Australia and overseas. It has been suggested that the umpiring in test series in Australia has been biased towards Australian teams. This paper uses logistic regression to analyse data from the test cricket series played in Australia from 1977 to 1994. It is found that, of the seven teams which have played against Australia over this period, three have significantly higher rates of leg before wicket decisions given against them than were given against Australia. Although this could be seen to be due to a bias towards Australian teams, other factors could account for these differences.\n      </p>", "The species of cricket Cicloptyloides americanus has males with 2n = 14 and females with 2n = 16 chromosomes.

This allows a calculation, at any stage of the innings, of the optimal scoring rate, along with an estimate of the total number of runs to be scored (in the first innings) or the chance of winning (in the second innings). The analysis is used to shed some light on possible batting tactics (in terms of the best run rate at any stage of the innings), to quantify the effects of selecting extra batsmen in a side, and to suggest a method for the development of alternative measures of player performance. Results suggest that scoring rates should be more uniform than at present, and that the team batting second has an advantage. Possible extensions to the model are discussed.\n      </p>", "W. Grey Walter built robotic systems to improve understanding of biological systems. In that tradition, this paper reports ongoing work on a robot model of cricket sound localization. The main advances are the inclusion of a much larger range of neuroethological detail, and the investigation of multimodal influences on the behaviour. The former allows exploration of the functionality of identified neurons in the insect, including the possible roles of multiple sensory fibres, mutually inhibitory connections, and brain neurons with pattern-filtering properties. The latter focuses on the inclusion of an optomotor stabilization response, and how this might improve tracking, particularly under conditions of random disturbance.\n      </p>", "Crickets are known to be inefficient sound producers. When calling, typically less than 1% of their metabolic energy is converted into sound. This low efficiency has been attributed to losses within the insect and to poor acoustic coupling with the environment. A previously uninvestigated factor that might contribute to low efficiency is ultrasonic radiation. If the impacts of the plectrum and file teeth excite vibration in the ultrasonic range, then the sound pressure level meters typically used to measure acoustic power would not accurately detect it. We made audible and ultrasound recordings of the calling songs of a phylogenetically diverse group of 6 cricket species, and, for comparison, 2 katydid species. In most of the cricket species, energy was present well into the ultrasonic region as a series of harmonics of the carrier frequency. However, the energy in these peaks was very small in comparison to the audible-range harmonics. There was no evidence of significant oscillations that were not harmonics of the carrier frequency. In all but one cricket species, over 97% of the total audible and ultrasonic energy was contained in the carrier frequency band.\n      </p>", "Females of many insects posses an ovipositor, which in crickets is usually used to place eggs deep into the soil. Ovipositor length in female striped ground crickets (Allonemobius socius) increased at higher latitudes and altitudes in North America, despite an opposing trend in overall body size. Crickets inhabiting regions with short growing seasons and long, cold winters invariably had longer ovipositors than crickets inhabiting warmer regions. The only exception to this observation was for first generation crickets in bivoltine populations where there was no pattern of geographic variation in ovipositor length. However, second generation females from these same populations always had longer ovipositors than their first generation ancestors,and followed a pattern of geographic variation similar to that found for univoltine crickets. Overall, these results support Masaki's (1986) model, which predicts that longer ovipositors will evolve in northern cricket populations as an evolutionary response to the selective advantages of overwintering eggs being oviposited deep in the soil in cold habitats. In order to determine the mechanisms underlying patterns of phenotypic variation in the wild, and to test the hypothesis that interpopulation variation reflects genetic differentiation while intergeneration variation within a population reflects environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity, crickets from eight populations were brought to the laboratory and reared through three generations in a common garden. It was found that laboratory-reared populations varied significantly in ovipositor length, with the pattern of variation mimicking that found for field-collected crickets. This finding supports the hypothesis that geographic variation in the wild has a significant genetic basis. The influence of environment on ovipositor length was examined in 20 full-sib families from a bivoltine population. Crickets reared in @'autumn-like@' conditions (30@?C, 15:9 h, L:D), such as might be experienced by second generation bivoltine crickets in the wild, were generally larger and had significantly longer ovipositors than siblings reared under @'spring-like@' conditions (27@?C 11:13 h, L:D). This pattern corresponds to that observed for bivoltine populations in the wild and suggests the importance of environmental cues for phenotypic plasticity, or polyphenism in ovipositor length in bivoltine populations of this cricket.\n      </p>", "Discussions about the evolution of female mating preferences have often suggested that females should express multiple strong preferences when different male traits are correlated with different mating benefits, yet few studies have directly tested this hypothesis by comparing the strength of female preferences for male traits known to be correlated with different benefits. In the variable field cricket, Gryllus lineaticeps, females receive fecundity and fertility benefits from mating with males with higher chirp rates and life-span benefits from mating with males with longer chirp durations. Although females prefer higher chirp rates and longer chirp durations when the other trait is held constant, it is possible that they give priority to one of these song traits when both vary. In this study, we examined the relative importance of chirp rate and chirp duration in female mate choice using single-stimulus presentations of songs that varied in both chirp rate and chirp duration. Females expressed both directional and stabilizing preferences based on chirp rate, responding most strongly to a chirp rate approximately one standard deviation above the population mean. Females did not express preferences based on chirp duration, and did not express correlational preferences. These results suggest that females may give priority to the reproductive benefits provided by males that produce higher chirp rates.\n      </p>", "The evolutionary trajectory of a trait depends not only on the presence of genetic variation, but also on the pattern of genetic correlations (rg) among traits. Genetic correlations are most easily measured under homogeneous, controlled laboratory conditions, whereas natural populations typically experience a higher degree of environmental variability The effect of environmental variability on genetic correlations in the cricket, Gryllus pennsylvanicus, was studied by measuring genetic correlations within and between two environments differing in levels of environmental heterogeneity. Within-environment rg among morphological traits measured in the homogeneous laboratory environment were found to be reliable predictors of rg measured in the experimental field environment. Laboratory measures of rg involving life-history traits, though, were not found to reflect the same correlations measured in the heterogeneous environment. A significant negative genetic correlation between fecundity and developmental time was found in the field environment, yet was not detectable when measured in the laboratory. Phenotypic correlations may be obtained much more easily than genetic correlations, but their usefulness in evolutionary inference depends on the pattern of similarity between the two correlations. A comparison of genetic and phenotypic correlations revealed a close match between the two measures for morphological traits, but revealed only broad similarities when considering life-history traits. Male-female genetic correlations between morphological traits were high (all rg &gt; 0.73) and were consistently higher in the field environment than in the laboratory. The genetic correlations between the sexes in developmental time followed the same trend, but the male-female genetic correlation of gonad weights was low in both environments. Across-environment correlations were found to be strong for morphological traits and for gonad weight, whereas the genetic expression of developmental time was found to be dependent on the environment in which the crickets were raised.\n      </p>", "Scientific literature often touts the many advantages of large body size, but seldom addresses the value of small body size. Yet selection for large size must be counterbalanced by selection for small size, otherwise, all animals would be large. In this paper, we demonstrate female-biased size dimorphism and a strong copulatory advantage for small males in a Jerusalem cricket (JC) (Stenopelmatus) from central California. We selectively paired male and female JCs of diverse body sizes and recorded their ability to copulate. All copulations were successful for males smaller or equal in size to females. In contrast, when the male was 6.1 mm longer than the female, copulation had only a 50% chance of occurring successfully. In general, as the difference between male and female body length increased (i.e., as males became longer than their mates), the probability of successful copulation decreased. These patterns of mating resulted in net selection for small male size and large female size. We also detected positive linear direct selection on male hind leg length, which may explain why male JCs have longer legs than females. The copulatory disadvantage of large males derives from the odd mating behavior of this group, in which males must contort and precisely align their bodies to couple. We believe that this is the first example of small-male advantage based solely on the physical aspects of copulation. In this species, small, not large, males have a copulatory advantage.\n      </p>", "A new genus Paranurogryllus, closely related to Anurogryllus Saussure, and two new species, P. capricornio and P. boraceia, are described.

One proposed mechanism for this decline is the negative effects of acidified precipitation on this acid-sensitive species. To test the predictions of this hypothesis, we sampled 570 randomly-selected sites along three transects in Ohio using chorusing surveys during 2004. Along these transects, we assessed pH and acid neutralizing capacity (alkalinity), as well as terrestrial and aquatic vegetation cover. Our surveys detected 53 extant Cricket Frog populations (9.3% of surveyed sites) in ponds, lakes, and streams. These sites were exclusively located in western Ohio, indicating a substantial (~120 km) range contraction, compared to its historic distribution in the state. A multiple logistic regression model found no significant relationship between Cricket Frog occurrence and either pH or acid neutralizing capacity (P &gt; 0.50). Acid neutralizing capacity and pH were also not significantly different in extant and extinct areas of the Cricket Frog's range in Ohio (P &gt; 0.05). Cricket Frogs were found to occur significantly more frequently than expected by chance in lakes and at sites with low canopy cover (P &lt; 0.001). While synergistic interactions with other factors cannot be ruled out, these results suggest that habitat acidification is likely not responsible for Cricket Frog declines in Ohio. Unlike other declining amphibians, where likely causal mechanism(s) have been identified, causes of Cricket Frog declines remain enigmatic.\n      </p>", "Snowy tree crickets synchronize their chirps by responding to the preceding chirp of their neighbors. If a neighbor's chirp precedes his own, a cricket shortens his chirp and the following interval. If it follows his own, he lengthens his chirp interval and sometimes the following chirp. A single response of the first type may advance his phase of chirping 160\u00b0 and one of the second type may retard it 200\u00b0.\n      </p>", "The orientation of southern cricket frogs was tested in a circular pen 60 ft in diameter located in water. With only the sun and sky visible, frogs moved in a direction corresponding to a line drawn perpendicularly toward the home shoreline. Accuracy of daytime orientation was not diminished after frogs were held 43 hr in total darkness. Animals collected by day and kept in total darkness oriented correctly when tested at night in view of the moon. Cricket frogs tested with only stars visible show bipolar orientation along the proper axis. When the same frogs were tested twice, the results were nearly identical. Successful orientation to home shores was observed in frogs displaced 15.1 mi and in those from 2 different shores when tested simultaneously. Reorientation to a new shoreline was evident after 3 hr and was virtually complete after a week.\n      </p>", "Rapid evolution has been well documented in naturally selected traits, but few examples exist for sexually selected traits, particularly sexual signals. This may in part be due to the complex set of behaviors associated with sexual signals. For a sexual signal to change, the change must be favorable for the signaler, but must also be accommodated by the receiver's perception and preferences. We investigated female accommodation of an extreme change in the sexual signal of Polynesian field crickets, Teleogryllus oceanicus. The cricket is native to Australia, widely distributed on Pacific Islands, and was recently introduced to Hawaii. Selective pressure by a deadly parasitoid fly favored a wing mutation in Hawaii (flatwing) that eliminates males' singing ability altogether. Despite conventional wisdom that females require males to produce a courtship song before mating, we show that females from ancestral, unparasitized Australian and Pacific Island populations as well as parasitized Hawaiian populations, will mate with silent flatwing males, suggesting this behavioral option predates the change in sexual signal. Furthermore, ancestral Australian females discriminate against flatwing males more severely than island females. We suggest island colonization favored females with relaxed mating requirements (Kaneshiro's effect) facilitating the rapid evolutionary loss of song in Hawaii.\n      </p>", "This work is concerned with the nature and magnitude of certain transverse aerodynamic forces on cricket balls in flight. The forces considered are those arising from the non-isotropy of cricket balls, that is those occurring mainly because the ball has a prominent seam around its circumference. The forces were measured for a variety of balls in experiments where the balls were either fixed in or projected through a wind tunnel jet. The principal objectives were to provide a set of results for the transverse swing of cricket balls, and to identify and consider the factors on which the effect depends. The experiments supported many, but not all, of the popular beliefs concerning the phenomenon. In particular, cricket balls swing well if the ball has a prominent seam inclined at a slight angle to the direction of projection, and if the surface of the ball is otherwise smooth. A small amount of back-spin imparted along the seam at projection helps to maintain the orientation of the ball during the flight. The experiments did not support the common belief that cricket balls swing more on humid days. Also, it is argued that 'late swing' is an uncontrollable effect. Perhaps the most important conclusion, however, is that the whole phenomenon is easily influenced by transient effects that are beyond control. Therefore swing bowlers should expect considerable variation in swing, even with new balls.\n      </p>", "Two new genera of nemobiine crickets, Amanayara and Monopteropsis are, respectively, described from the forests of eastern Brazil and the mountains from Magdalena, Colombia.

Our explanation hinges instead on two key factors: first, the degree to which elites chose either to appropriate the game and deter others from participating or actively to promote it throughout the population for hegemonic purposes; and second, the degree to which the game was \"popularized\" by cultural entrepreneurs looking to get and keep spectators and athletes interested in the sport. Both outcomes relate to the nature of status hierarchies in these different societies, as well as the agency of elites and entrepreneurs in shaping the cultural valence of the game. The theoretical significance of this project is thus the observation that the diffusion of cultural practices can be promoted or discouraged by intermediaries with the power to shape the cultural meaning and institutional accessibility of such practices.\n      </p>", "A critical prediction of the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis is that the expression of secondary sexual traits should be positively correlated with pathogen resistance ability. This correlation is necessary if females are to be able to use a particular sexual trait as an indicator of a male's resistance ability. In this study we document a positive correlation between a sexually selected component of the calling song of male house crickets (the number of syllables per chirp) and haemocyte load, an important determinant of the ability to encapsulate pathogens in insects. The results indicate that, by favouring males which produce more syllables per chirp, females may also select males with higher pathogen resistance ability, potentially generating either direct or indirect selection on female mating preferences.\n      </p>", "The parasitoid fly Ormia ochracea uses the calling song of its host Gryllus spp. to locate an area inhabited by potential hosts. Once a calling male has been located, O. ochracea deposits live larvae on the host, and on substrates surrounding the host to enable the larvae to attach to and enter individuals in the vicinity of the calling male. In Texas, where O. ochracea parasitizes the Texas field cricket Gryllus texensis, we observed juvenile crickets in the mating aggregations that form around calling males. Juvenile G. texensis crickets are, therefore, potentially susceptible to parasitism by O. ochracea. Here we investigated whether laboratory reared juvenile field crickets could successfully host O. ochracea larvae. We found that juvenile crickets were appropriate hosts for O. ochracea. /// La mosca parasitoide Ormia ochracea usa el canto de cortejo del hospedero Gryllus spp. para ubicar las \u00e1reas habitadas por hospederos potenciales. Una vez que el canto del macho ha sido localizado, O. ochracea deposita larvas vivas sobre el hospedero y sobre los sustratos alrededor del hospedero para que larvas pueden atar y entrar los individuos en la vecindad del canto del macho. En Texas, donde O. ochracea parasita el grillo de campo Tejano, Gryllus texensis, observamos grillos juveniles en las agregaciones de apareamiento que se forma alrededor de los machos cantando. Los grillos juveniles de G. texensis entonces son potencialmente susceptibles al parasitismo por O. ochracea. Aqu\u00ed, investigamos si los juveniles de los grillos de campo criados en el laboratorio pueden exitosamente ser hospederos de las larvas de O. ochracea. Encontramos que los juveniles de los grillos fueron hospederos apropiados para O. ochracea.\n      </p>", "Swarming and mass migration are spectacular and sometimes devastating features of the biology of various animal species. These phenomena are typically associated with actual or anticipated depletion of food resources after an increase in population density, but the mechanisms driving such collective movements are poorly understood. Here we reveal that insects in large, coordinated migratory bands consisting of millions of Mormon crickets in western North America were deprived of two essential nutritional resources: protein and salt. The insects themselves provided a major source of these nutrients, and cannibalism was rife. We show that protein and salt satiation reduced cannibalism and that protein satiation inhibited walking. Additionally, experimentally reducing the motility or mobility of crickets substantially increased their risk of being cannibalized by other band members. As a result, the availability of protein and salt in the habitat will influence the extent to which bands march, both through the direct effect of nutrient state on locomotion and indirectly through the threat of cannibalism by resource-deprived crickets approaching from the rear. The crickets are, in effect, on a forced march. Migratory band formation and subsequent mass movement, therefore, are manifestations of specific tradeoffs between the costs and benefits of group living. Bands afford antipredator benefits to individual group members. Group movement then mitigates the resulting costs of intraspecific competition, namely local depletion of nutritional resources and the associated increased risk of cannibalism.\n      </p>"],

For Joyce, what was a fatal flaw in the plan of the master builder became a methodology for discovery. Following Origens dictum to \"search the scriptures till you find a stumbling block,\" Joyce loaded his last work with offences and scandals. In this way he used stumbling, falling, and erring as \"portals of discovery\" in his never-ending linguistic adventure.

Similarly, there were no significant differences between programs for students who achieved at average levels. Nonetheless, significantly more students in program C achieved at the lowest test level, failing third grade, and significantly more students in program F achieved at the highest level.

This article examines how myths told by women in western Viti Levu, Fiji, represent a site of resistance (Abu-Lughod, 1990) wherein hegemonic understandings of gender are contested. This is achieved through a \"transformation of signs\" (Hall, Critcher, Jefferson, Clarke and Roberts, 1978) that sees authoritative male figures depicted as powerless, challenges a spatial order that privileges men, and attacks an order of knowledge that declares vision the dominant mode for the apperception of knowledge. By contravening dominant meanings, these myths present a \"rupture of representation\" (Sharpe, 1995) that subverts reigning constructions of truth. I argue that anthropology's understanding of the legitimizing role of myth must be tempered by an appreciation of its potential as a \"risk to the sense of signs\" (Sahlins, 1987: 149). /// Comment et dans quels domaines culturels est-ce que les femmes contestent, contredisent ou inversent les id\u00e9ologies li\u00e9es \u00e0 la condition sexuelle?

This efficiency approach has been especially useful with mature firms, where the structure of debt and limits to managerial spending decrease the downside risk and possible failure of the firm. This article illustrates how buyouts can also create entrepreneurial opportunities and allow upside growth. In particular, it focuses on understanding the aspects and circumstances of the entrepreneurial mindsets of managers who seek upside growth through buyouts. These entrepreneurial mindsets provide a wider view of buyouts as a vehicle for renewal that frequently leads to revitalization and strategic innovation. The article provides insights for entrepreneurs, managers, and financiers by articulating four categories of buyout opportunity--efficiency, revitalization, entrepreneurial, and failure buyouts.

The key features are the French nationality of the migrants; the role of women in the labour force; the importance of public sector employment; and the varied level of skills acquired. Aggregate sources are used to describe detailed occupational distributions while records of individual migrants illustrate the process of migration and the influences on employment.

All persons living in institutions for the elderly (n = 258) and community dwellers (n = 804) scoring less than 24 points on the MMSE (18.4%) were invited to undergo a medical evaluation at home by a qualified neurologist using the CERAD battery. We found 177 cases of dementia (9.2%), including 82 cases of AD (5.5%). Prevalence of AD increased significantly with age and was higher among women (OR: 4.24) and persons with no formal educational level (OR: 2.47). While a MMS score less than 24 was more frequent among persons with a foreign native language (OR: 3.05), the OR of AD was not significantly associated with native language. The proportion of AD among persons suffering from senile dementia was 45% among elderly living in institutions and 69% among those living in the community. Prevalence rates in south-eastern France are similar to the average rates for Europe. This study underlines the need to investigate the relationships between native language, MMSE and AD on the one hand, and the link between a low MMSE score and institutionalisation of patients suffering from AD on the other.\n      </p>", "Drawing on a survey of 406 British home owners in five d\u00e9partements in France, this study explores the geography of first and second home acquisitions in terms of differences between origin and destination area. Examining the reasons why people buy homes in rural France, it is shown that those from South West England mainly move to France permanently because of its cheaper cost of living, while those from the southern counties of South East England seem to use France as an accessible arena for acquiring a 'genuine' rural home. Within France, there are clear differences in the rationale for buying homes in particular places. Buyers in Calvados seek an 'escape' from Britain in a location close to ferry ports, those in Charente-Maritime are drawn by its relatively cheap 'sun and sand' environment, with Dordogne and Lot buyers being attracted by traditional rural landscapes. Vaucluse receives wealthier buyers with stronger prior connections with France.

Attention is drawn to the ways in which, on the contrary, written law was at first a southern phenomenon, following a much earlier Roman tradition rather than one of post-Revolutionary Jacobin enlightenment.

Since the last census, the departments of western France have experienced slightly faster population ageing than the national average, while in the southern Mediterranean departments it has tended to be slower. Flows of foreign migrants to France have increased since 1996, the increase being due mainly to foreigners from non-EU countries. The rise in the total period fertility rate has continued and even accelerated in 2000. It is highest for women over 30, though the fertility of younger women is also thought to have increased. The completed fertility of the generations born in the 1960s is nonetheless falling, and is expected to settle at just over 2 children per woman. Despite the introduction of the Civil Solidarity Pact giving legal recognition to couples of either sex, 2000 proved particularly favourable to marriage, with over 300 000 celebrated, a figure not reached since 1983. The increase in the average length of life of women has slowed since the 1980s, whereas that of men, after having been held back by AIDS, has resumed at a quickened pace. For men, the greatest improvements are at adult ages, while for women they involve mainly the oldest old. /// Seg\u00fan el censo de 1999, la poblaci\u00f3n de los departamentos situados en el Limousin y su entorno tiene la estructura por edad m\u00e1s envejecida de Francia, mientras que la poblaci\u00f3n de Ile-de-France (excluyendo Par\u00eds) y del Norte es la m\u00e1s j\u00f3ven, con una elevada proporci\u00f3n de j\u00f3venes y un n\u00famero reducido de personas de 60 a\u00f1os o m\u00e1s.

In 2003, the prevalence of ESRD in France was 0.087%. Of the 52,000 ESRD patients, 30,882 were receiving dialysis and 21,233 had functioning renal transplants. The annual expenditure per ESRD patient in 2003 was estimated at \u22f940,975. Autodialysis, at \u22f949,133 per patient per year, was much less expensive than dialyzing in-center at either a public or private facility (\u22f9111,006 and \u22f975,125, respectively).

Using data from individuals banded on their wintering grounds and recovered on their breeding areas, we show that such proportions are estimable given that 1) all breeding populations are identified, and 2) the wintering population can be stratified into \u22651 more site than the number of breeding populations. We applied this technique to woodcock (Scolopax rusticola) banded while wintering in France (N = 35,000) and recovered in other European countries (N = 520). We estimated that the proportion of eastern woodcock among those wintering in France varied spatially, ranging from 70% in northwest France to nearly 100% in southeast France, and increased substantially over the last 15 years. Overall, the method appears powerful to quantify spatial variation of the composition of a population receiving individuals from various origins.\n      </p>", "Ixodes ricinus is considered as the main vector of Lyme Borreliosis in France. The aim of our investigations was to obtain a comprehensive view of the spatial risk linked to the distribution of the species in our country. Previous studies [1] have provided strong evidence that the species populations are widely distributed, so the objective of the present work was to ascertain the bacteriological infection of the tick by the agent of the zoonosis (Borrelia burgdorferi, sensu lato), over the French territory, whatever the ecological conditions may be. For this purpose, we kept the same framework as that used in our acarological investigation, a phytoecological zoning of the territory into 54 geographically separate and ecologically distinct units distributed into three climatic zones. Batches of ticks, picked up in these different phytoecological units (only two thirds of which were sampled), were submitted for bacteriological investigation. A total of 4,673 ticks were examined, individually, for the presence of Borellia burgdorferi, by immunofluorescence. Percentages of infection according to the various stages of Ixodes ricinus free stages, collected by flagging, were as follows: 4.95% in 3,247 nymphs, 11.2% in 699 males, 12.5% in 727 females. Larvae were ignored. Practically all the tested units harboured the bacterium. The percentage of tick samples (25 ticks or more) absolutely free of Borrelia, wherever they came from, is very low (not exceeding 10 percent of the sampled forests). Our study confirms the assessment of a widespread distribution of the zoonosis in France which was, until now, exclusively based on an approximate distribution of limited human cases observed in the country.\n      </p>", "David Siddle has recently sought to challenge the orthodox view about the history and geography of literacy development in early-modern France using evidence from a peasant community in the Savoy.

The results show that R. sanguineus is the main vector. Certain aspects of this tick species are of interest: affinity for man, close contact with humans for a long periods, peak of tick population (preimaginal stages) at the same time as the peak of the disease. The largest populations of R. sanguineus are noted in the endemic zone of human rickettsiosis. The fact that immature stages are more prevalent during the hot season and these forms' ability to bite humans is important and may suggest a role for them in the epidemiology of the disease. The sporadic isolation of this species outside the endemic zone may explain the occurrence of isolated cases of the disease in these areas. We cannot currently exclude vector roles for the two other species, which can parasitize humans, though none of our data supports this hypothesis.\n      </p>", "Many French wines, and now other kinds of agricultural products, manifest the process of \"patrimonialization\" as a counterforce to the homogenizing trends in the globalization of world food systems. The appellation contr\u00f4l\u00e9e (AOC) concept, which dates from 1935, is the oldest expression of that patrimonial process. In it, the characteristics of a place-the terroir-are used to gloss its legally protected, territorial definition on which hinge claims to a place-based product authenticity and, by extension, quality. AOC implementation, now with almost seven decades of experience in France, serves as the model to understand how the application of terroir to place has focused on land-use practice, wine definition, vinicultural tradition, and landscape preservation. A complementary process at work is product salience that establishes its individuality in an interactive expectation between producer and consumer. Fieldwork in the commune of Cassis (Department of Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne) in the South of France sorted the set of historical, environmental, and economic conditions to reveal the actual functioning of these two processes at a local level. Appellation Cassis contr\u00f4l\u00e9e, the third oldest and one of the smallest AOC in French viniculture, comprises 180 ha of vineyards and fourteen wine growers. In this case, establishment of product authenticity has been a continuous process. Wine types have evolved in spite of the absence of real innovation; political territory has been used to define terroir; the discourse of quality depends heavily on the historic past; vineyards have acquired a community value beyond any productivity; and producers have defined and defended their territory to boost its prestige to themselves and their consumers. The key entity in the appellation is the lower winegrowers syndicate. Presumptive statements, promotional rhetoric, consumer desire, and the politics of local decision making have shaped this wine region far beyond its environmental associations.\n      </p>", "L'accroissement naturel en France continue \u00e0 \u00eatre l'un des plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s de l'Union europ\u00e9enne, car la structure par \u00e2ge de la population est encore assez favorable aux naissances, et relativement peu aux d\u00e9c\u00e8s.

Desde el 2004, la inmigraci\u00f3n procedente de terceros pa\u00edses (fuera de la Union Europea) no ha aumentado. El indicador coyuntural de fecundidad se establece en 1,92 hijos por mujer, ocupando as\u00ed el segundo lugar en Europa, tras Irlanda. El aumento de la inmigraci\u00f3n ha contribuido tan s\u00f3lo por un tercio en el aumento de la fecundidad en Francia desde 1997. A nivel de departamentos administrativos, no hay relaci\u00f3n entre la evoluci\u00f3n de la presencia extranjera y de la fecundidad. A pesar de esta recuperaci\u00f3n de la fecundidad anual, la descendencia final de las generaciones nacidas tras 1960 disminuye y se acerca progresivamente a 2 hijos por mujer. Mientras que el n\u00famero de Pacs (pactos civiles de solidaridad) se ha incrementado en un 50 % en 2005, el n\u00famero de matrimonios ha permanecido estable. En 2003 y 2004, los divorcios han vuelto a aumentar y el indicador coyuntural de tasa de divorcios se acerca ya al 45 %. La fuerte ca\u00edda de la mortalidad se ha confirmado en el a\u00f1o 2005, con una esperanza de vida al nacer de 76,8 a\u00f1os para los varones y de 83,8 a\u00f1os para las mujeres. En 2004, la ca\u00edda de la mortalidad fue particularmente importante para las mujeres de m\u00e1s de 65 a\u00f1os.

Due to the important decrease in the number of deaths after a week, perinatal mortality accounts for the 3/4 of both foetal and infant mortality in France to-day. The main factors of perinatal mortality are: legitimacy, sex, multiple births, place of delivery, father's social status, mother's age, duration of pregnancy. In the present state of medical knowledge, only about 50% of the causes of deaths can be accurately determined. /// Bajo la denominaci\u00f3n de mortalidad perinatal, se engloban la mortinatalidad y las defunciones de los menores de una semana.

Despite these developments, the completed fertility of the birth cohorts of the 1960s is declining, and may settle at slightly over two children per woman. The introduction of the Civil Solidarity Pact (PACS, Pacte Civil de Solidarit\u00e9) did not prevent the number of marriages in 2000 and 2001 from exceeding 300,000, the highest figure since 1983. Yet the proportions never married (according to the legal definition) are progressing strongly across cohorts. In 2001, life expectancy at birth passed the threshold of 83 years for women and 75.5 years of men. At present, male gains are most significant in adulthood, whereas females gains are concentrated at the older ages. Mean household size continues to fall; the mean number of persons per dwelling in the 1999 census was 2.4. Slightly more than three dwellings in ten are occupied by one person only. A large majority (60%) are women, but their predominance is weakening, as the proportion of men living alone is increasing rapidly at nearly all ages. By contrast, the proportion of men and women living as partners is declining at all ages except the oldest. Children are increasingly less likely to live with married parents, and more likely to live with unmarried parents or in one-parent families. /// Desde 1996, los flujos de entradas de extranjeros en Francia han aumentado, especialmente los flujos de extranjeros no originarios del espacio econ\u00f3mico europeo.

The proportion of ever-married men and women at age 50 decreases from one cohort to the next, while the mean age at first marriage is increasing. The frequency of union dissolution (divorces and separation of unmarried couples) has increased considerably. These changes in conjugal behaviour are raising the number of adult men and women who live alone. Life expectancy registered an exceptional increase in 2004 (+0.9 years for women and +0.8 years for men), and this cannot be explained solely by a \"harvest effect\" following the exceptional mortality in 2003 due to the August heatwave, or by the absence of an influenza epidemic in 2004. Mortality among the elderly is continuing to decline, and this decrease is largely responsible for the increase in mean length of life, for women in particular. /// El a\u00f1o 2004 estuvo marcado por una fuerte disminuci\u00f3n de la mortalidad, un aumento del n\u00famero de nacimientos y por consiguiente un crecimiento natural relativamente elevado.

The luxury magazine F\u00e9mina (1901-38) forged a psychological approach to the issue. It developed a range of significant representational strategies to appeal directly, if synthetically, to the reader's sense of self. Moreover, F\u00e9mina constructed the interior, like the magazine itself, as a metaphor for the imaginative negotiation and performance of a range of ideal feminine subject positions. These representational mechanisms and models of femininity are analysed as the means to unpack the notions of feminine subjectivity being defined in relation to the interior.\n      </p>", "A cross-sectional sero-epidemiological study was conducted on forestry workers, a high risk population for Lyme borreliosis.

Shoveler numbers exceeded the Ramsar criterion of international importance (i.e., 400 individuals) during most of the winter. Birds concentrated first at sewage works, showing a diel pattern of foraging depth which could be linked to vertical migrations of crustaceans. Zooplankton density decreased over the winter, leading the Shovelers to abandon the site for natural areas. The two sites which hosted most ducks were those where straining the water surface for zooplankton was the most frequent feeding behavior. At the two other sites, straining was gradually replaced by deeper foraging, possibly because Shovelers at least partially turned to benthic invertebrates. This study suggests that food abundance is of crucial importance for winter habitat selection by Shovelers, and that even the sites with abundant foods in autumn may not be able to sustain large concentrations of Shoveler through an entire winter. Our results support previous studies which highlighted the importance of some artificial wetlands for the conservation of this duck species.

En el per\u00edodo 1995-2005, la baja de la mortalidad en las edades muy avanzadas (alrededor de los 80-85 a\u00f1os) fue el principal motor del aumento de la esperanza de vida de las mujeres; para los hombres, es la baja alrededor de los 65-70 a\u00f1os la que ha permitido los mayores progresos.\n      </p>", "In early 1840, France was rocked by the news that, following the disappearance in Damascus of a Capuchin monk and his assistant, the Jews of that town had been accused of ritual murder. French political interests in the region meant that they took a great interest in the proceedings. Feeding this interest was an ongoing fascination with the Orient, including its Jewish population. The willingness of many French to believe that the Jews of Damascus were indeed guilty of ritual murder was fueled by depictions of Oriental Jews as rapacious or sensual. In France, Jews were conspicuously involved in trying to help their coreligionists in Damascus, and this led some commentators to question their loyalties. Orientalist stereotypes of Jews ultimately led to freer and more aggressive criticism of Jews in French society. The Damascus Affair provided the starting point for such criticism.\n      </p>", "In August 2003, Western Europe experienced a deadly heat wave. It is estimated that 15,000 people died in France from its direct effects. Applying an indirect estimation technique to the monthly number of deaths by sex, age, and place of residence for the period 1996\u20142003, we estimate the number of years that would have remained to those who died from the heat wave had they been spared. The paper also evaluates the role of the 'harvesting' effect of the 2003 heat wave in explaining the deficit of deaths recorded in 2004\u2014estimated at 23,000 out of an expected total of 535,000 deaths. The harvesting effect was modest and accounted for fewer than 5,000 of the 'missing' deaths in 2004. The mortality decline in 2004 is thus due mainly to other factors. One hypothesis is that special efforts have been directed towards isolated older people as a consequence of the heat wave.\n      </p>", "L'indicateur conjoncturel de f\u00e9condit\u00e9 a poursuivi son redressement en 1998 et 1999, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une assez forte reprise de la f\u00e9condit\u00e9 des femmes de 30 \u00e0 40 ans, et \u00e0 une stabilisation de celle des plus jeunes.

In spite of this, completed fertility is expected to gradually decline after the 1960 birth cohort, falling below the replacement level (2.1). The overall number of abortions is stable though tending to increase slightly among young women and decline among older women. Following the strong recovery in 1996 consequent on tax law changes less favourable to unmarried couples with children, the increase in marriage is continuing at a more moderate level, though the proportion never-married at age 50 continues to rise rapidly. After a slight fall in 1996, the number of divorces remained stable in the next two years, and the period index stands at 38 divorces per 100 marriages. Assuming no further increase, the proportion of marriages ending in divorce will be 29% for couples married in 1970 and 35% for those married ten years later. For a number of years, men's life expectancy at birth has been rising slightly faster than that of women: at almost all ages, except for over 70, progress has been slightly better for men than for women. This new pattern appears to be due to the absence of improvements over certain cancers affecting women and even a deterioration for some smoking-related cancers. /// El \u00edndice sint\u00e9tico de fecundidad sigui\u00f3 creciendo en 1998 y en 1999 gracias al aumento de la fecundidad de las mujeres de 30 a 40 a\u00f1os y a la estabilizaci\u00f3n de la fecundidad de las m\u00e1s j\u00f3venes.

During the 1990s, political asylum lost much of its legitimacy, as new criteria based on humanitarian claims became more common in appeals for immigration. Asylum seekers were increasingly identified as illegal immigrants and therefore candidates for expulsion, unless humanitarian reasons could be found to requalify them as victims deserving sympathy. This substitution of a right to asylum by an obligation in terms of charity leads to a reconsideration of Giorgio Agamben's separation of the humanitarian and the political, suggesting instead a humanitarianization of policies. Sangatte Center, often referred to as a transit camp, became a symbol of this ambiguous European treatment of the \"misery of the world\" and serves here as an analytical thread revealing the tensions between repression and compassion as well as the moral economy of contemporary biopolitics.\n      </p>", "The \"headscarf affair,\" Muslim girls wearing veils to school, has generated a storm of controversy in France. This study uses the headscarf affair to explore Muslim immigrant women's views of their place in French society and reveals that even those who disagree with French public opinion often invoke arguments that are more French than North African. Interviews with 41 North African women show that younger, well-educated women defend the headscarf as a matter of personal liberty and cultural expression. Older, poorly educated women either defend or reject the veil but never discuss the issue of secularism. In dismissing the veil, they rely on a different understanding of Muslim womanhood. A third group opposes the veil, arguing that the goal of school is integration. Respondents' answers are interpreted according to structural factors and cultural repertoires, both North African and French.\n      </p>", "The literature on winegrowing in the southwest of France, or Aquitaine, has largely recounted the past of the Bordeaux merchants and winegrowers who developed the celebrated grand crus. While the developers of quality wines did control the production and marketing of wine in the Aquitaine as a whole, missing from the literature are accounts of small growers of the interior who produced table wines and who forged the wine cooperative movement in the early twentieth century. This omission is attributable to a historical conjuncture that subordinated the producers of table wines to those who produced the grand crus while elevating these quality wines as the quintessential representative of the French wine industry. An ethnographic perspective, or one of critical historiography, on the wine cooperative movement can help to restore a plurality of winegrowing pasts.\n      </p>", "French rhetoricians of the seventeenth century\u2014among them Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9nelon, Bernard Lamy, Ren\u00e9 Bary, and Ren\u00e9 Rapin\u2014brought about a profound shift in the landscape of their discipline. Their texts call into question the centrality of rhetorical figures (part of the elocutio), the dispositio, and other artful rhetorical precepts, while placing increased emphasis on delivery (pronuntiatio). In most cases, they realized this new emphasis via one of two novel approaches: the first relied upon a Cartesian taxonomy of the passions, whereas the second sought to abandon precepts altogether in the quest for transparent, or \u201cNatural,\u201d representation. Even while adopting contrasting methods, representatives of both approaches were unanimous in regarding rhetoric and music as sister disciplines. Furthermore, French musicians and rhetoricians alike rejected the prevailing idea that the relationship between these disciplines was hierarchical, with rhetoric the dominant sibling. This shift helps to explain why the notion that music \u201cimitates\u201d the structures and conventions of rhetoric, while popular in other regions, is to be found in no French source after ca. 1640. Yet, many recent studies continue to perpetuate such hierarchies, mapping onto musical works rhetorical concepts unknown or consciously avoided in France.\n         Relating a nuanced depiction of multiple French rhetorical practices to music-centered writings by Bacilly, La Croix, Lecerf, Grimarest, and others reveals that the very same aesthetic positions evident among rhetoric texts also shaped the era's discourse on music. More broadly, because no tradition existed in French musical discourse of articulating aesthetic matters until Lecerf's Comparaison de la musique italienne et de la musique fran\u00e7aise (1704\u20131706), the intersection of music and rhetoric offers a rare means of constructing an aesthetics of musical eloquence in seventeenth-century France.\n      </p>", "Conventional explanations of the distribution of winemaking regions emphasize the influence of edaphic and atmospheric environments of the vine. This paper argues that legislation that reflects the political power of the prestigious winemaking areas has had a major impact, especially in France. The appellation legislation of France, and the assumptions underlying it, are established. It is conceptualized as a form of territorialization devised to regulate and capture advantages to some of the participants in the industry. I analyze the influence of the French principles and assumptions in devising the European Community and California legislation. In particular, I consider the manner in which the underlying environmental determinism is used both to explain the distribution of prestigious wines and as criteria to establish wine regions. The distribution of vine varieties in France and California illustrates the tight control evident in France compared with the laissez-faire policies in California. Some evidence of converging patterns in the two territories is apparent.\n      </p>", "Combined archaeological and ecological investigations in a large ancient oak forest in Central France have revealed a dense network of ancient human settlements dating from the Roman period. We demonstrate a strong correlation between present-day forest plant diversity patterns and the location of Roman farm buildings. Plant species richness strongly increases toward the center of the settlements, and the frequency of neutrophilous and nitrogen-demanding species is higher. This pattern is paralleled by an increase in soil pH, available P, and \u03b4\u2071\u2075N, indicating the long-term impact of former agricultural practices on forest biogeochemical cycles. These extensive observations in a forested region on acid soils complement and confirm previous results from a single Roman settlement on limestone. Ancient Roman agricultural systems are increasingly being identified in contemporary French forests; the broad extent and long-lasting effects of previous cultivation shown in this study require that land-use history be considered as a primary control over biodiversity variations in many forest landscapes, even after millennia of abandonment.\n      </p>", "Even though France has experienced increasing and inevitable feminization in its immigrant population since 1974, research has tended to ignore the role of immigrant women, especially Muslim women, in the migration process. Public attention has been diverted by concern over such relatively marginal issues as the headscarf affair, and insufficient attention has been paid to the important role Muslim women play in France, especially those coming from Algeria. These women function as cultural mediators between the traditional culture of the sending country and the modern one of the host country. They see themselves as both tradition-bearers and integration proponents. The demands of immigration have given rise to the growth and development of different leaders, among them cultural mediators seeking a bridge between Islam and modernity, economic mediators seeking to establish women in the media and as entrepreneurs, and political mediators who seek access to power at the local level for the immigrants. These new mediators will eventually shape a new generation of female actors very far from the traditional countries of origin, although for the time being they still suffer from the inequality of rights for women and chances in their overall social life.\n      </p>", "The Camargue in southern France is a well defined biogeographic region of wetlands. Nine species of colonial Charadriiformes breed there. We compare changes in these populations between 1956 and 1991 on both local and regional scales. The local scale is represented by three main breeding areas, two commercial salinas and a saltmarsh. The use of these two spatial scales allows determination of the factors that may explain the population trends and to estimate their relative importance. Immigration seems to explain the population increases of several species; however, habitat modification by man and competition for breeding sites are two principal factors explaining local changes. These local factors should be responsible for colony distribution changes within the region. /// Dans le sud de la France, la Camargue repr\u00e9sente une r\u00e9gion de zone humide bien d\u00e9limit\u00e9e.

Examination of alternative constructions of the peasant by scholars, politicians, persons identified as peasants, or creators of popular culture affords insights into a variety of tensions at the core of French society. For example, the peasant has stood for a heritage, a cultural diversity, a strand of French national identity in marked opposition to a highly unified identity derived from a powerful center. Scholarly accounts of the modernization of France, organized around analyses of the disappearance of peasants, are presented as one example of the use of peasant images to express and periodically to resolve a central contradiction in French society.\n      </p>", "A hospital-based surveillance system of infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been implemented in nine wards of the Bordeaux University Hospital by the Groupe d'Epid\u00e9miologie Clinique du SIDA en Aquitaine (GECSA). The aim was to systematically collect clinical, biological and epidemiological data on HIV-infected patients who were followed by physicians from the participating hospitals. The analysis of the data at enrollment was performed on the 1,242 patients whose infection was diagnosed between January 1983 and December 1989. The male to female ratio was 2.5:1 and the proportion of women has increased over time. For men, 39.8% were homosexual or bisexual, 36.9% were intravenous drug users (IVDU's) and 2.6% had both risk behaviours. For women, the most frequently reported high-risk behaviour was IVDU (50.3%), followed by heterosexual contacts with an HIV-infected or at-risk person (HET) (28.6%). The distribution of risk behaviour has changed over time, with an increase in the proportion of HET and a decrease in the proportion of IVDU's for both sexes. The proportion of patients included that fulfilled the definition for AIDS was 18.9%. Based on this system, the incidence rate of diagnosis of HIV infection in the Aquitaine region, regardless of the clinical stage of the infection was estimated to be at least 63.4 per million inhabitants and per year in 1988-1989. The GECSA surveillance system points out some of the specificities of the progression of the HIV epidemic in the Aquitaine region.

Au niveau d\u00e9partemental, il n'y a pas de relation entre \u00e9volution de la pr\u00e9sence \u00e9trang\u00e8re et de la f\u00e9condit\u00e9. Malgr\u00e9 ce redressement de la f\u00e9condit\u00e9 annuelle, la descendance finale des g\u00e9n\u00e9rations n\u00e9es apr\u00e8s 1960 diminue et se rapproche progressivement de 2 enfants par femme. Alors que le nombre de Pacs a progress\u00e9 de 50 % en 2005, le nombre de mariages est rest\u00e9 stable. En 2003 et 2004, les divorces ont recommenc\u00e9 \u00e0 augmenter, et l'indicateur conjoncturel de divortialit\u00e9 est maintenant proche de 45 %. La forte baisse de la mortalit\u00e9 est confirm\u00e9e en 2005, avec une esp\u00e9rance de vie \u00e0 la naissance de 76,8 ans pour les hommes et de 83,8 ans pour les femmes. En 2004, la chute de la mortalit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 particuli\u00e8rement forte pour les femmes de plus de 65 ans. Depuis 1990, la surmortalit\u00e9 masculine s'est un peu r\u00e9duite entre 15 et 70 ans, mais au-del\u00e0 de 70 ans, les progr\u00e8s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 plus importants pour les femmes. C'est autour de 45 ans que les progr\u00e8s sont les plus faibles, en particulier pour les femmes entre 40 et 55 ans. /// A fecha 1 de enero de 2006, Francia metropolitana ten\u00eda 61 millones de habitantes. La poblaci\u00f3n se increment\u00f3 en un 5,6 por 1000 en el 2005, y casi las tres cuartas partes de dicho incremento se debi\u00f3 al crecimiento natural. Desde el 2004, la inmigraci\u00f3n procedente de terceros pa\u00edses (fuera de la Union Europea) no ha aumentado. El indicador coyuntural de fecundidad se establece en 1,92 hijos por mujer, ocupando as\u00ed el segundo lugar en Europa, tras Irlanda. El aumento de la inmigraci\u00f3n ha contribuido tan s\u00f3lo por un tercio en el aumento de la fecundidad en Francia desde 1997. A nivel de departamentos administrativos, no hay relaci\u00f3n entre la evoluci\u00f3n de la presencia extranjera y de la fecundidad. A pesar de esta recuperaci\u00f3n de la fecundidad anual, la descendencia final de las generaciones nacidas tras 1960 disminuye y se acerca progresivamente a 2 hijos por mujer. Mientras que el n\u00famero de Pacs (pactos civiles de solidaridad) se ha incrementado en un 50 % en 2005, el n\u00famero de matrimonios ha permanecido estable. En 2003 y 2004, los divorcios han vuelto a aumentar y el indicador coyuntural de tasa de divorcios se acerca ya al 45 %. La fuerte ca\u00edda de la mortalidad se ha confirmado en el a\u00f1o 2005, con una esperanza de vida al nacer de 76,8 afios para los varones y de 83,8 a\u00f1os para las mujeres. En 2004, la ca\u00edda de la mortalidad fue particularmente importante para las mujeres de m\u00e1s de 65 a\u00f1os. Desde 1990, la sobremortalidad masculina se reduj\u00f3 un poco entre los 15 y los 70 a\u00f1os, pero m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de los 70 a\u00f1os, los progresos han sido mayores para las mujeres. Los menores progresos han sido alrededor de los 45 a\u00f1os sobretodo para las mujeres entre 40 y 55 a\u00f1os.\n      </p>", "This paper presents an overview of the phytogeography of the ancient administrative division of Picardy, Northern France, which today includes the modern departements of the Somme, Oise and Aisne. A rich and varied region, geologically the province embraces the northern portion of the Cretaceous outcrops which form the Paris Basin. Bioclimatically, the are represents an important zone of tension between the atlantic domain of Europe, which characterizes most of the north of the region, and the Central-European domain, elements of which penetrate the southern parts of Picardy. Study of the vegetation in the region over the last 30 or so years has clearly semonstrated that the great diversity created by the pattern of geology, soils, topography, climate and human use may be essentially classified into six major biogeographical sectors, namely: a) Tertiary Picardy, which embraces the plateaux, escarpments, great alluvial valleys and bogs of the Vexin francais, the Valois, the Soissonnais, the Laonnois, and parts of the Tardenois and Brie. This area of acid sands, clays and Tertiary limestones still possesses fine remnants of the vast forests which once clothed most of the region, as well as enclaves of warm limestone grassland and more rarely heaths and bogs, all despite the fact that it is now largely a zone industrial agriculture practised on a grand scale. (b) Norman Picardy, which comprises the eastern portion of the Pays de Bray, a distinctive enclave characterized by a narrow breached anticline, which has revealed Lower Cretaceous sands and clays, that in turn support rare forests, meadows, heaths and bogs in a land otherwise completely surrounded by chalk. (c) Preardennes Picardy, which embraces the part of the Thierache that falls in Picardy, a land of bocages and great forests, with montane influences apparent. (d) Champagne Picardy, which comprises the vast dry chalk plain to the east of Laon, where 'islands' of calcareous woodland still persist in a 'sea' of agriculture. (e) Chalkland Picardy, which represents the most characteristic and dominant realm of Picardy, presenting a jigsaw of cereals and sugarbeet on chalk plateaux masked by limon and clay-with-flints, with deep valleys edged by chalk grassland and woodland and filled with calcereous marshes and large lakes. (f) Maritime Picardy, which comprises the chalk cliffs, dunes and fenlands that face the English Channel, and which, in the Marquenterre, still supports one of the finest areas of wetland in France. This paper thus reviews the biogeography produced by the distinctive interplay of geology, soil, topography, climate and human landuse in the pays of Picardy, identifying the characteristic vegetation associations and flora of each of the main biogeographical divisions.\n      </p>", "Diatom studies of French running waters over more than twenty-five years revealed the recent appearance of a number of species which could not have been overlooked before because of their abundance or size. Their absence in modern European floras supports the idea of a recent introduction of these taxa in Europe. Their distribution and progression in France are examined according to available data. Taxa not yet found in France until 1990 but showing an important proliferation and rapid dispersal since that time are considered as invasives. This is the case, for example, for Gomphoneis minuta, a diatom originally described in North America, reported in Europe for the first time in the River Ard\u00e8che in 1991 and presently occurring throughout southern France up to the Loire. Among the so-called exotic taxa, Navicula jakovljevicii, Achnanthes catenata, A. subhudsonis sensu lato and Nitzschia cf. tropica have probably been misidentified in the past. Their distribution must be reexamined from existing slides collections. A new species, Eolimna comperei, is described by light and electron microscopy; its recent discovery in France appears to be related to the introductions in Europe of a number of diatoms from other continents. The most remarkable taxa are of tropical origin and proliferate in summer. The abundance of Hydrosera triquetra in French estuaries and of Diadesmis confervacea in power plant discharges and various rivers in southwestern France, illustrates their recent acclimatization under temperate conditions. The study of the spatio-temporal extension of these as well as of less abundant forms of recent appearance, e.g. Capartogramma crucicula, Encyonema triangulum, Gomphoneis eriensis var. variabilis, Luticola mitigata, Luticola peguana, Nitzschia elegantula, Nitzschia dissipatoides or Gomphosphenia oahuensis, might provide indications of the warming of running waters in Western Europe due to the \"greenhouse effect.\" /// Les investigations men\u00e9es sur le r\u00e9seau hydrographique fran\u00e7ais depuis plus d'un quart de si\u00e8cle ont permis de recenser dans les eaux courantes un certain nombre d'esp\u00e8ces de diatom\u00e9es qui n'auraient pas pu passer inaper\u00e7ues auparavant en raison de leur abondance ou de leur taille. Leur absence m\u00eame des flores europ\u00e9ennes modernes semble conforter l'id\u00e9e d'une apparition r\u00e9cente. La localisation d'une quinzaine d'esp\u00e8ces est d\u00e9crite ainsi que leur progression chaque fois que des donn\u00e9es sont disponibles. Ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme \"invasives\", les esp\u00e8ces non encore signal\u00e9es en France avant 1990 et qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 de v\u00e9ritables prolif\u00e9rations et dont l'extension est rapide dans les cours d'eau. C'est le cas en particulier de Gomphoneis minuta d\u00e9crit en Am\u00e9rique du Nord, observ\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois en Europe dans l'Ard\u00e8che en 1991, et qui colonise aujourd'hui toute la France m\u00e9ridionale jusqu'\u00e0 la Loire. Parmi les formes exotiques, Navicula jakovjlevicii, Achnanthes catenata, Achnanthes subhudsonis sensu lato ou Nitzschia cf. tropica ont probablement fait l'objet de confusions syst\u00e9matiques par le pass\u00e9 et la confirmation de leur apparition r\u00e9cente n\u00e9cessite une consultation des collections existantes. Une nouvelle esp\u00e8ce de Naviculac\u00e9es, Eolimna comperei, est d\u00e9crite en microscopie photonique et \u00e9lectronique. La d\u00e9couverte r\u00e9cente en France de ce taxon est probablement aussi due aux introductions en Europe de diatom\u00e9es originaires d'autres continents. Le cort\u00e8ge le plus remarquable est constitu\u00e9 par des formes connues comme tropicales qui prolif\u00e8rent en France en p\u00e9riode estivale. L'abandance dans les estuaires fran\u00e7ais d'Hydrosera triquetra ou celle de Diadesmis confervacea dans les rejets d'eau chaude de certaines centrales thermiques et dans diverses rivi\u00e8res du sud-ouest t\u00e9moigne d'une acclimatation r\u00e9cente de ces taxons sous nos climats temp\u00e9r\u00e9s. L'\u00e9tude de leur progression en France, comme celle de formes moins repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es telles que Capartogramma crucicula, Encyonema triangulum, Gomphoneis eriensis var. variabilis, Luticola mitigata, Luticola peguana, Nitzschia elegantula, Nitzschia dissipatoides ou Gomphosphenia oahuensis d'apparition r\u00e9cente, pourrait bien apporter dans un futur proche, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments utiles aux scientifiques pr\u00e9occup\u00e9es par \"l'effet de serre\" ou le r\u00e9echauffement de notre plan\u00e8te.\n      </p>", "A recent American survey of attitudes toward societal multiculturalism vs. assimilation has found surprisingly widespread support for maintaining heritage cultures not only among immigrant minority groups but also among most subsamples of majority \"host\" groups, black and white. Working-class whites are the one exception. This pilot study explores the same attitude domain in a contrasting European setting. Randomly selected samples of middle- and working-class families (a mother, father, and teenage son or daughter) from a small city in France were interviewed. As a group, they were neutral to slightly favorable to immigrants maintaining heritage cultures and languages rather than losing them through assimilation. On measures of attitudes toward specific immigrant groups, there were marked intergroup differences with \"Maghrebian Arabs\" rated least favorably and Southeast Asians, the \"model\" immigrants, most favorably. Comparisons of subgroups of respondents who varied in terms of (a) political left-right orientation, (b) social class standing, (c) degree of religiosity, and (d) generational level provide the base for a more general discussion of cultural assimilation and multiculturalism.\n      </p>", "We analyzed 814 cases of meningococcal disease notified in 1987 and 1988 to the Ministry of Health. Data were obtained by report forms including informations about possible additional cases among contacts. Coprimary cases (occurring within 24 hours after the index case) and secondary cases (occurring more than 24 hours after index case) were all reviewed. Twenty eight clusters of meningococcal disease were identified involving 65 cases (8% of total cases). Twelve of the 814 cases (1.5%) were coprimary cases of an index case and 25 (3%) were secondary cases. The secondary attack rate was 530/100,000 among household contacts and 31/100,000 among school contacts. Seventy two per cent of the secondary cases occurred in the first week after index case. Thirty-eight percent of the secondary cases occurred in the 15-20 age group as opposed to 15% of single cases. Serogroup A was more often found in coprimary (33%) and secondary cases (17%) than in single cases (6%). In France, prophylaxis of secondary cases is administered to the classroom contacts of a case of meningococcal infection but is not required for the entire school except under epidemic conditions.\n      </p>", "Whether non-European Mediterranean populations also benefit from the protective effect on health of the so-called Mediterranean diet is not known yet, as national mortality statistics are available in neither North Africa nor the Near East. This article investigates the cancer profile of Maghrebian and Near Eastern migrants, by gathering and discussing data from recent studies on cancer mortality in Mediterranean migrants of various origins in France and Australia. In France, the migrants originating from Morocco, and in Australia, the migrants originating from the Near East, have a lower mortality from all cancers than their host countries and than Italian migrants. Concerning specific sites, Moroccan and Near Eastern migrants have a cancer profile which is quite similar to that of the Italian migrants, with relatively low risks compared with the local-born for certain cancers typical of affluent societies (colon and rectum, breast, ovary, and prostate). In addition, the non-European Mediterranean migrants are protected even more than the Italians in the same host country from esophagus cancer, and Moroccans in France have a much lower risk than the local-born for lung cancer. Lastly, they tend to have a relatively high risk for some cancers which are likely to have a viral etiology: e.g., nasopharynx (Italians and Near Easterners), liver (Near Eastern males), and possibly cervix (Moroccans).\n      </p>", "Abortion was legalized in France in 1975. Several amendments to the Abortion Act were passed in 2001 aimed at facilitating women's access to pregnancy termination. In particular, the maximum gestational age at which elective termination may be performed (the legal limit) was extended by two weeks. Data from induced abortion notifications can be used to study the impact of these amendments, by using the gestational age at termination as an indicator of difficulty in accessing termination services. Following the legalization of medical methods of contraception in France in 1967, the decline in unplanned pregnancies and elective terminations up to the mid-1990s can be attributed to the effective diffusion of medical methods of contraception in the 1970s and 1980s. Abortion rates nevertheless remain high in France compared with other western European countries. This raises two issues that warrant investigation: the persistence or increase in unplanned pregnancies among the youngest women, and repeat abortions by some women in their lifetimes. La loi autorisant l'avortement depuis 1975 en France a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e en 2001 dans le but de faciliter l'acc\u00e8s des femmes aux services d'interruption volontaire de grossesse (IVG), en particulier par l'augmentation de deux semaines de la dur\u00e9e de gestation maximale autoris\u00e9e. Les donn\u00e9es provenant des bulletins d'IVG permettent d'\u00e9tudier l'impact de ces modifications l\u00e9gislatives, en utilisant la dur\u00e9e de gestation au moment de l'IVG comme indicateur des difficult\u00e9s d'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 ce service. Par ailleurs, la loi autorise la contraception m\u00e9dicalis\u00e9e depuis 1967 en France ; la diminution des grossesses non pr\u00e9vues et des IVG jusqu'au milieu des ann\u00e9es 1990 est attribuable au succ\u00e8s de la diffusion de ces m\u00e9thodes dans les ann\u00e9es 1970 et 1980. Le recours \u00e0 l'avortement reste cependant \u00e9lev\u00e9 en France par rapport aux autres pays d'Europe de l'Ouest. Cela pose la question de la persistance ou de la recrudescence des grossesses non pr\u00e9vues chez les femmes les plus jeunes et celle du recours r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'avortement au cours de la vie de certaines femmes. La ley que autoriza el aborto voluntario en Francia desde 1975 ha sido modificada en 2001, con el fin de facilitar el acceso de las mujeres a los centros que practican el aborto, especialmente prolongando de dos semanas la duraci\u00f3n m\u00e1xima de gestaci\u00f3n autorizada. Los datos de los boletines de aborto permiten estudiar el impacto de estas modificaciones legislativas, utilizando la duraci\u00f3n de gestaci\u00f3n en el momento del aborto como indicador de las dificultades de acceso a los citados centros. Por otra parte, desde 1967 la ley autoriza en Francia los anticonceptivos medicalizados; la disminuci\u00f3n de los embarazos involuntarios y de los abortos hasta la mitad de los a\u00f1os 1990 es atribuible al \u00e9xito de la difusi\u00f3n de estos m\u00e9todos durante los a\u00f1os 1970 y 1980. Sin embargo, el recurso al aborto es todav\u00eda elevado en Francia respecto a otros pa\u00edses de Europa del Oeste. Este hecho plantea la cuesti\u00f3n de la persistencia o del recrudecimiento de los embarazos involuntarios en las mujeres m\u00e1s j\u00f3venes, as\u00ed como el recurso repetido al aborto a lo largo de la vida f\u00e9rtil en el caso de ciertas mujeres.\n      </p>"], "words": {"wetlands": {"number": 1}, "since": {"number": 2}, "migratory": {"number": 1}, "increasingly": {"number": 1},

The particular phenomenon considered in detail is the ejection of the thin layer of molten material. This thin layer is modelled as an inviscid flow between the fluid surface and fluid/solid interface, both of which are unknown moving boundaries. Through a regular asymptotic expansion, the governing equations are reduced to a combination of the shallow water equations in the zero gravity limit and a two-phase Stefan problem; the key small parameter is the square of the aspect ratio. These leading-order problems exhibit shocks which represent a possible mechanism for the previously unexplained fluid clumping. Approximate formulas and a parameter grouping are derived to predict the rate of melt solidification during ejection. Finally, weak formulations of the convection-diffusion equation for energy conservation are presented. These weak formulations are novel because the fluid is moving across a solid surface. An appropriate extension to the enthalpy method is suggested as a first stage toward numerical calculations.\n      </p>", "The importance of the centre of percussion (CP) of some hand-held sporting equipment (such as tennis rackets and baseball bats) for athletic performance is well known. In order to avoid injuries it is important that powerful blows are located close to the CP. Several species of glyptodont (giant armoured mammals) had tail clubs that can be modelled as rigid beams (like baseball bats) and it is generally assumed that these were useful for agonistic behaviour. However, the variation in tail club morphology among known genera suggests that a biomechanical and functional analysis of these structures could be useful. Here, we outline a novel method to determine the CP of the glyptodont tail clubs. We find that the largest species had the CP very close to the possible location of horny spikes. This is consistent with the inference that they were adapted to delivering powerful blows at that point. Our new analysis reinforces the case for agonistic use of tail clubs in several glyptodont species.\n      </p>", "Eighty-nine consecutive patients with suspected intracranial masses were examined by auscultatory percussion in a blind study to assess the sensitivity of the procedure. Each patient underwent computed tomography (CT) of the brain as part of his medical care, and the results were compared with those of auscultatory percussion. Fifty-one of the patients had abnormal CT scans, of whom 44 (86%) had abnormal (positive) findings on auscultatory percussion; seven (13%) yielded false-negative results. Each of the patients with subdural haematomas had distinctly positive findings by auscultatory percussion. Of the 38 patients with normal CT scans, 11 had strokes with hemiparesis, and each had positive findings in the contra-lateral hemisphere by auscultatory percussion. The remaining 27 patients with normal CT scans were healthy; 25 had normal findings on auscultatory percussion, two (7%) gave false-positive results. Twenty subjects were studied with phonoscopy. Auscultatory percussion is easy to perform and is clinically useful.\n      </p>", "Firearms identification procedures continue to play a role in the archaeological study of battles and warfare. Percussion caps, if well preserved, have the potential to yield unique individual tool marks that can be microscopically examined to determine a minimum number of weapons present at a specific site. This study analyzed 110 percussion caps from an 1854 U.S. Army and Apache battle site and determined that at least 34 firearms were used in the battle. A validation study using modern percussion caps from 11 known weapons was also undertaken to demonstrate the potential for percussion cap analysis in future studies.\n      </p>", "Petroglyph manufacture probably often involved indirect percussion, especially for carefully made lines and edges of larger figures. Experimental replication shows that during indirect percussion, debitage is produced from the chisel-stone that should be recoverable in archaeological context at rock art sites. Following experiments that demonstrated how the debitage is produced, this report describes its characteristic shape and provides suggestions as to what sorts of contexts might contain this evidence.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This study reviewed whether sex-instrumentation distributions prevalent in US and English cultures was due to a limited geographical representation of extant research. We gathered data regarding sex and instrument selection from many diverse geographical regions. Data from a sample of 8146 community and youth band participants from 25 countries (170 ensembles) supports previous research. Gender bias permeating US and England instrumentation in wind and percussion ensembles appears not to be limited to these countries, but exists elsewhere around the world. In most countries, male participants outnumbered females. The data demonstrate that females overwhelmingly populated flute and clarinet sections. Oboe and bassoon were other instruments where females considerably outnumbered males. There was a sex imbalance across the totality of all ensembles, because males predominantly populated the remaining instruments (saxophone, trumpet, horn, trombone, euphonium, tuba, and percussion). It would seem that the more traditional roles of females and males (in terms of instrument selection) are borne out in many ensembles from around the world. We recommend identifying several ensembles whose member rosters reflect these more traditional sexlinstrument matches, and those whose member rosters reflect more gender-neutral instrument matches to review possible influences for these differences.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

On observe ainsi d'importantes variations au sein d'une m\u00eame culture, qui ne s'expliquent pas par l'abondance ou la raret\u00e9 des ressources proches. Par ailleurs, autour d'un m\u00eame lieu d'approvisionnement, les choix techniques vont diff\u00e9rer radicalement au cours du temps. Comme pour des d\u00e9bitages complexes, il convient de distinguer plusieurs param\u00e8tres: les territories d'acquisition, le niveau technique de la culture \u00e9tudi\u00e9e, l'organisation sociale ou encore les activit\u00e9s r\u00e9alis\u00e9es sur l'habitat.

On the Armorican Massif, implementation of bipolar percussion on an anvil is generally observed for the knapping of fluvial and sea pebbles, from the Epipalaeolithic to the Bronze Age. For a present-day observer, this process seems to be most evident for th exploitation of small spherical or avoid pebbles. However, this natural and simplistic determinism cannot stand up to a comparative analysis carried out on the whole of the Armorican Massif. The observation of important variations within a same culture cannot be explained by the abundance or rarity of nearby lithic resources. Moreover, around a same supply area, technical choices may radicaly vary over time. In the same way as for complex knapping modes, several parameters should be distinguished: supply areas, technical levels of the culture being considered, social organisation or settlement activities. As a general rule, this method is characteristic of Neolithic cultures and not of the Mesolithic cultures.\n      </p>", "The first movement of Bart\u00f3k's Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion (1937) has been noted for its Beethovenian use of sonata form and shares a number of features with the 'Waldstein' Sonata. This article examines the relationship between these two composers and these two works, starting with an examination of Bart\u00f3k's use of sonata form. It attempts to establish whether Bart\u00f3k borrowed gratefully from his predecessor in an attempt to 'synthesize' old and new, folk and art, or whether he misread Beethoven in the anxious process of carving a place for himself in the musical canon.\n      </p>", "Percussion plays a major role in many rituals of the Maya Indians of Zinacantan. In order to explain the symbolic meaning held by ritualistic percussive sounds, six major types of percussion are examined. While Needham's hypothesis of a universal link between percussion and transition in social life is valuable and appears to be substantiated in Zinacanteco rites, percussion has other symbolic associations as well. Percussive sounds convey numerous messages, serving as signaling devices, punctuating the passage of solar time, and also symbolizing aspects of the natural world.\n      </p>", "The total variability in archaeological material derives from at least 4 different sources: technological, functional, stylistic, and random variation. Different attributes may be needed to quantify each aspect of the total variability, and the particular attributes that the archaeologist singles out for analysis will determine, to a large extent, the utility and validity of any subsequent typology. At present, there is relatively little theory to aid in the selection of the attributes most appropriate for a particular archaeological problem. In the analysis of prehistoric flake stone tools, the technology of flake production falls largely within the realm of the natural sciences; thus, technological variability is perhaps that aspect of the total variability for which suitable theory may be most readily developed. Flake production can be divided into 2 distinct processes, percussion flaking and pressure flaking, on the basis of the duration of the applied force. The fracture processes involved in these 2 types of flake production are sufficiently different to warrant a separate treatment of each. Attention is focused specifically on percussion flaking because this process appears to have been the predominant mode of flake production throughout most of human prehistory and, at present, it remains poorly understood. It is found that a percussion flake is detached from a core largely by a process known as spalling, the fracture produced by the reflection of a stress wave at the free surface of the core adjacent to the striking platform. The thickness of a flake is a function largely of 4 impact parameters and 2 constants of the material: the shape, intensity, and wavelength of the stress wave emanating from the point of impact, the angle of incidence of the stress wave on the free face of the core, the critical impact strength of the material in tension, and an elastic property of the material. Other attributes of flake size such as the length, width, area, weight, and volume are also influenced by these parameters. Several other factors affecting the size of a flake are discussed, and areas where further research is needed are outlined. It is concluded that the various attributes of flake size are highly and predictably interrelated.\n      </p>", "Des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de perles en cornaline, \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents stades d'\u00e9laboration, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9s en surface, \u00e9pars \u00e0 Larsa, concentr\u00e9s sur une petite surface \u00e0 P.L.

Because Orff Schulwerk instruction is one of the most prevalent pedagogies in elementary music education, this study examined the rehearsal strategies of recognized Orff Schulwerk teachers as they worked to refine learned repertoire for percussion instruments. Eight instructors and their upper elementary students were videotaped in four regular rehearsals each. Systematic analyses of rehearsal frames in which teachers were working to improve student performance revealed fast teacher pacing and a predominance of instructional directives that were procedural (e.g., where to begin playing) rather than musical (e.g., how to perform more accurately or expressively). The majority of students' performance problems were related to precision, often caused by rushing the underlying pulse. Instructional targets were most often related to technique. Students successfully accomplished proximal goals in 63% of the performance trials in which the targets were verbalized by the teacher prior to performance and in 74% of the performance trials when the targets were verbalized by the teachers while students were playing. Students were most successful when teachers used clear, explicit directives and positive modeling.\n      </p>", "The prime function of the clown (chou) in jingju (Beijing \"opera\") has often been considered as light entertainment, but there is evidence that could support a different interpretation. The clown is associated with the origin of Chinese acting, and performance shows a fundamental relationship between the clown and drumming which comes from shamanism. While other martial roles share some of the tie to percussion, the improvisational freedom of the clown, the customary verse the clown uses, drumming, and parallels to Taoist ritual music may point back to shamanistic roots. If this is true, the clown's comedy may come from exorcism and not only joking.\n      </p>", "The frequency and morphology of notches produced on bovid long bones by carnivore gnawing (tooth notches) and hammerstone-on-anvil breakage (percussion notches) are quantified. Notches are semicircular- to arcuate-shaped indentations on fracture edges with corresponding negative flake scars on medullary surfaces. We restrict our analysis to notches produced under controlled conditions by either carnivores or hammerstones when diaphyses are breached to extract marrow. Percussion notches are characteristically more frequent, and, in cortical view, broader and shallower than tooth notches. The flakes removed from percussion notches are typically broader, and have a more obtuse release angle, than those removed from tooth notches. These morphological differences are statistically significant for notches on Bovid Size 1 and 2 long bones but not on Bovid Size 3 long bones. Notches should be more durable than marks produced by carcass consumers on bone surfaces because they penetrate the entire thickness of the bone. As a result, notches are not easily obscured by weathering, chemical corrosion, or adhering matrix. Given this durability, and the initial success we have had in distinguishing the actor responsible for notch production on modern bones, notches can be used, with some limitations, to identify bone consumers archaeologically.\n      </p>", "The first and third movements of B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k's Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta (1936) are subjected to a pitch-based (here strictly distinguished from pc-based) analysis, with the idea of defining ways, here called zones of impingement, in which pc-based observations may be incorporated into such an analysis without invoking the generalizing power that pitch class is usually thought to have over pitch.\n      </p>", "In an attempt to discern the quantitative parameters diagnostic of specific load applications (i.e. hard- and soft-hammer percussion and pressure flaking) used in flint knapping, approximately 1,500 experimentally produced flakes were analyzed.

I start my discussion with a comparison between relief operations in Europe after the first and second world wars. In contrast to 1918, humanitarian efforts in 1945 pertained to displaced persons and refugees found outside their countries of origin: an unprecedented instance of mass displacement on the European continent. Although narrowly framed in 1943 in terms of ' Relief and Rehabilitation', Western humanitarianism was tied to the broader issues of forced migration and genocide. In a second section I examine how relief operations can be seen as an illustration of the Anglo-Saxon ' human rights talk' during the wartime period. UNRRA and private welfare organizations fed, housed and clothed refugees at a time when Roosevelt's call for 'freedom from want' was translated into a new set of basic human rights. Western humanitarianism was implementing on the ground some of the general principles proclaimed by the 'human rights revolution' of the 1940s. In a third section I focus on some of the political aspects of relief operations. I discuss the place of Jewish refugees in humanitarian politics and argue that relief operations did much to recognize Jewish Holocaust survivors as a specific national entity, with important consequences for their access to self-determination. I also show how relief efforts rapidly evolved into a commitment to protect political asylum: in this way, postwar humanitarianism was part and parcel of the emergence of the 'West' in the context of the Cold War.\n      </p>", "I examine the role of humanitarianism and compassion in an emergent ethical configuration that makes illness a primary means by which undocumented immigrants obtain legal residency (\"papers\") in France. I argue that the sacred place of biological integrity in this ethical discourse leads immigrants to trade in biological integrity for political recognition. I demonstrate first how humanitarianism has been transformed into a form of politics, functioning as a transnational system of governance tied to capital and labor even while purporting to be apolitical. I focus in the second half of the article on the consequences of humanitarianism as politics, which include new biopolitical practices, unexpected diseased and disabled citizens, and a limited version of what it means to be human.\n      </p>", "The scale, scope, and significance of humanitarian action have expanded significantly since the late 1980s. This article reflects on two ways in which humanitarianism has been transformed. First, its purpose has been politicized. Whereas once humanitarian actors attempted to insulate themselves from the world of politics, they now work closely with states and attempt to eliminate the root causes of conflict that place individuals at risk. Second, a field of humanitarianism has become institutionalized; during the 1990s the field and its agencies became more professionalized and rationalized. Drawing on various strands of organizational theory, I examine the forces that have contributed to these transformations. I then explore how these transformations have changed the nature of what humanitarian organizations are and what they do. In the conclusion I consider how the transformation of humanitarianism links to the relationship between international nongovernmental organizations and world order, including the purpose of humanitarian action and its distinctive function in global politics.\n      </p>", "This essay explores the possible negative consequences of identifying the current situation in Gaza primarily as a humanitarian problem. Scholarship on the complicated effects of humanitarian action in general, the early history of humanitarian intervention in the lives of Palestinians, and the current politics of aid in Gaza all underscore these problems. The essay reflects on several aspects of what can be called the \u201chumanitarianism problem\u201d in Gaza by considering both how humanitarianism is sometimes deployed as a strategy for frustrating Palestinian aspirations and the often unintended political effects of the most well-intentioned humanitarian interventions.\n      </p>", "In this article, I consider the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) relief project in Gaza (1948-50) to explore ethical dilemmas that are endemic to humanitarianism. Considering humanitarian practice from this distinctive perspective can shed new light on this arena. Exploration of the \"ethical labor\" of Quaker practice in Gaza illuminates an ethical practice that joined concern for others with care of the self, a practice that was equally attentive to an obligation to be \"in the world\" and to be true to oneself. The debates and practices of AFSC volunteers in Gaza reveal humanitarianism as a field of compromised action.\n      </p>", "In this article, I explore the intersection of humanitarian practice and refugee law in shaping categories of \"refugee\" and \"citizen\" in Gaza in the first years after 1948. I examine how humanitarian practice produced enduring distinctions within the Gazan population and provided a space in which ideas about Palestinian citizenship began to take shape. A key argument is that humanitarianism, despite commitments to political neutrality, often has profound and enduring political effects. In this case, humanitarian distinctions contributed to making the \"refugee\" a central figure in the Palestinian political landscape. I also consider how humanitarianism in Palestine was guided by the larger, emerging postwar refugee regime, even as Palestinians were formally excluded from some of its mechanisms.\n      </p>", "Humanitarianism - that is, the political, economic and military interference in the domestic affairs of a state justified by a nascent transnational morality - is one of the defining and most controversial features of the post-Cold War period. This article advances nine theses, arguing that humanitarianism has a simplistic worldview, that coercive humanitarian actions trigger negative consequences, that humanitarianism is quite effective in sheltering Western states from the spillover effects of political crises but is less so in solving the problems it claims to address. These arguments are illustrated with reference to four prominent cases: Bosnia, Kosovo, Rwanda and Darfur. The article concludes with a brief outline of an alternative humanitarian approach.\n      </p>", "Each year, over 100,000 children are apprehended entering the United States unaccompanied by parents or legal guardians, and without valid immigration documents. As many as 8,000 of these children are placed in an elaborate system of border patrol detention centers, shelter facilities, and courts. While the Department of Health and Human Services (through the Office of Refugee Resettlement) funds programs that care for the undocumented immigrants, the Department of Justice, (through the Department of Homeland Security) sweeps up and deports the very same children (or their parents). Apprehended children therefore bring to light the competing agendas of security and humanitarianism. Based on interviews with policy makers and program officers, visits to the shelters, and interviews with the children, this article explores the politics of compassion surrounding these migrants. In order to provide more humane and egalitarian response to the migration, the tensions and contradictions inherent in current practices need to be made more conscious. Considering migration from Mexico, Central America, China, and India, the paper challenges the racially and ethnically-coded system that protects some children more than others. Rather than dismantling the politics of compassion, what is needed is a clearer understanding of the children's paths to the United States, and a system without the racial and ethic hierarchies that are currently in place. Otherwise, children will be confined to the space between the war on terror that treats immigrants, even below the age of 18, as security threats, and politics of compassion that emerged from early 21st century immigration reform.\n      </p>", "This article sets out to establish a taxonomy of Christian faith-based humanitarian agencies, challenging assumptions that such agencies are similarly informed by Christian theology and pursue a uniform mission. Christian principles and missionary efforts are central in the development of humanitarianism, and the agencies associated with the Christian tradition comprise a prominent and growing portion of international humanitarian agencies. Little, however, is known about how Christian faith-based agencies diverge from one another in their orientation and operations, how their theological tradition shapes their humanitarianism, and whether or how they are distinct from secular agencies. Examining the humanitarianism of Christian faith-based agencies in light of their theological roots, this article delineates three classifications of Christian faith-based agencies: Accommodative\u2013Humanitarian, Synthesis\u2013Humanitarian, and Evangelistic\u2013Humanitarian agencies. The study demonstrates the importance of distinguishing not simply between faith-based and secular agencies, but among faith-based agencies themselves.

Dieser Artikel hat es sich zum Ziel gesetzt, humanit\u00e4re Organisationen, die auf christlichem Glauben basieren, zu klassifizieren und stellt dabei die Annahme, dass solche Organisationen auf christlicher Theologie basieren und diesselbe Mission verfolgen, in Frage. Christliche Prinzipien und missionarische Bem\u00fchungen stehen im Mittelpunkt der Entwicklung einer humanit\u00e4ren Einstellung und mit christlicher Tradition assoziierte Organisationen stellen einen bedeutenden und wachsenden Anteil unter internationalen humanit\u00e4ren Organisationen. Allerdings ist wenig dr\u00fcber bekannt, wie Organisationen, die auf christlichem Glauben basieren, sich voneinander in Orientierung und Operation unterscheiden, wie deren theologische Tradition deren Humanit\u00e4t beeinflusst und ob oder wie sie sich von s\u00e4kularen Organisationen unterscheiden. Die Humanit\u00e4t von auf christlichem Glauben basierenden Organisationen unter Ber\u00fccksichtigung ihrer theologischen Wurzeln begutachtend, beschreibt dieser Artikel drei Gruppen von auf christlichem Glauben basierenden Organisationen: versorgend\u2013humanit\u00e4r, synthetisch\u2013humanit\u00e4r und evangelistisch\u2013humanit\u00e4r. Die Studie zeigt, wie wichtig es ist, nicht einfach zwischen auf Glauben basierenden und s\u00e4kularen Organisationen zu unterscheiden, sondern auch unter den auf Glauben basierenden Organisationen selbst. Este trabajo pretende establecer una taxonom\u00eda de las organizaciones humanitarias religiosas cristianas y cuestiona las ideas de que estas organizaciones tienen en com\u00fan su teolog\u00eda cristiana y persiguen una misi\u00f3n similar.

Poco se sabe sin embargo sobre qu\u00e9 es lo que diferencia a las agencias religiosas cristianas entre s\u00ed en cuanto a orientaci\u00f3n y trabajos, c\u00f3mo influye su tradici\u00f3n teol\u00f3gica en su humanitarismo y si se distinguen de las organizaciones seculares. Este trabajo, que analiza el humanitarismo de las organizaciones religiosas cristianas desde el punto de vista de sus ra\u00edces teol\u00f3gicas, esboza tres clasificaciones de organizaciones religiosas cristianas: las acomodativas-humanitarias, las sint\u00e9ticas-humanitarias y las evangelistas-humanitarias. El estudio demuestra la importancia de distinguir no solo entre las organizaciones religiosas y seculares, sino entre las propias organizaciones religiosas.\n      </p>", "In the contemporary world humanitarianism in the form of the pursuit of human/social development has emerged as a major focus of international conferences.

I open by reviewing the changing relationship between multilateralism, sovereignty, and humanitarianism, and link that conceptual discussion to the international refugee regime. I then argue that the combination of state pressures and the normative principle of popular sovereignty enabled a more political and pragmatic UNHCR to widen its activities under the humanitarian banner and to become more deeply involved in the circumstances in the refugee-producing country. This expanding humanitarian umbrella, I suggest, might be a stealth agent for a policy of containment and a threat to refugee rights. This possibility is suggested by recent debates over the category of internally displaced peoples; the decided preference for repatriation; and UNHCR's involvement in reintegration activities. These developments generate the worrisome possibility that a more pragmatic UNHCR is potentially (though unwittingly) implicated in a system of containment. I conclude by reflecting on UNHCR's role in global politics and the dangers of a sovereignty-led humanitarianism.\n      </p>", "In this article, I examine the evolving tradition of t\u00e9moignage (witnessing) maintained by the international humanitarian organization M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res-Doctors Without Borders. Comparing this practice to traditions of virtuous testimony by the public intellectual and the gentleman scientist I suggest that collective actors like nongovernmental organizations now play a central role in defining secular moral truth for an international audience. By integrating medical expertise and public expression, the work of this group illustrates an overtly motivated form of scientific research, finding facts in the name of values, in the pursuit of both technical and ethical ends.\n      </p>", "Immigration policies in Europe in the last three decades have become increasingly restrictive. During the 1990s, political asylum lost much of its legitimacy, as new criteria based on humanitarian claims became more common in appeals for immigration. Asylum seekers were increasingly identified as illegal immigrants and therefore candidates for expulsion, unless humanitarian reasons could be found to requalify them as victims deserving sympathy. This substitution of a right to asylum by an obligation in terms of charity leads to a reconsideration of Giorgio Agamben's separation of the humanitarian and the political, suggesting instead a humanitarianization of policies. Sangatte Center, often referred to as a transit camp, became a symbol of this ambiguous European treatment of the \"misery of the world\" and serves here as an analytical thread revealing the tensions between repression and compassion as well as the moral economy of contemporary biopolitics.\n      </p>", "The witness has become a key figure of our time, whether as the survivor testifying to what he has lived through or as the third party telling what he has seen or heard. Publicly bearing witness of suffering and injustice is precisely what departs the first (International Red Cross) and second (Doctors without Borders, Doctors of the World) ages of humanitarianism. Based on an etymological inquiry of the word in Greek and Latin and on an ethnographical investigation into the production of documents on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, this analysis of the politics of testimony shows how the humanitarian agents define the legitimate manner to tell the world the \"victims' truth.\" In particular, the increasing presence of psychiatrists and psychologists on the field introduces a new vision in which trauma appears less as a clinical category than as a political argument. This process of subjectification of Palestinians but also of Israelis as victims, which institutes their experience and condition as shared, leaves aside both the individual and collective histories of the subjects.\n      </p>", "This article argues for the importance of rewriting the conventional atrocity narrative about violence in King Leopold's Congo Free State in relation to the present, the ongoing war-related humanitarianism and sexual violence in the \"DRC\". The central idea is to push beyond the shock and tenacity of the visual, the ubiquitous mutilation photographs that tend to blot out all else; and instead seek weaker, more fragile acoustic traces in a diverse archive with Congolese words and sounds. This sensory, nonspectral mode of parsing the archive tells us something new about the immediacy of violence, its duration in memory, and the bodily and reproductive effects of sexually torturing women. The sound of twisted laughter convulsed around forms of sexual violence that were constitutive of reproductive ruination during the rubber regime in Leopold's Congo. The work of strategically tethering the past to the present should not be about forging historicist links across time but about locating repetitions and difference, including differences among humanitarian modes and strategies in the early 20th and the early 21st centuries.\n      </p>", "The circumstances and nature of humanitarianism have changed in recent years. The traditional ideals of neutrality, impartiality, and independence have become myth. Rather than being at the margins of conflict, humanitarianism is now e mbedded within contemporary conflict. States use humanitarian norms and actors for their own ends, frequently as a response to international pressure to intervene in conflicts. Such actions, as well as those on the part of international humanitarian organizations and other nonstate actors, have altered the terrain of humanitarian action.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

This article examines critically: the relevance of Darwinian and Lamarckian models of international relations to the evolution of international ethics and institutions; and the possibility that the ethics and norms are likely to be more consistent with existing world orders than challengers to it. Specifically, this article draws from evolutionary social science and organizational theory to develop a framework to explore the initial diversity of the meaning and practices of humanitarianism; how the combination of environmental mechanisms and organizational culture led many humanitarian agencies to adapt to their environment in ways that incorporated politics; and the subsequent countermovement by some agencies who wanted to purify humanitarianism. I then apply this framework to explain the recent history of four international aid agencies. I conclude with several observations regarding how the model as applied to these cases allows us to examine critically the selection mechanisms that do and do not account for ethical change and how scholars of international norms, ethics, and progress should be attentive to how principled actors are creatures of the world they want to transform.\n      </p>", "Humanitarianism and politics are more often than not considered to be separate from each other, despite the increasing complexity of contemporary conflict.

To date, little attention has been paid to the very different ways human rights and humanitarian movements have conceptualized impartiality in relation to distinct and conflicting activist goals. The contemporary role of impartial activism can be better understood by examining these historical differences and how they eroded as the two movements encountered the responded to challenging political dilemmas. This has contributed to a common formulation of impartial activism that paradoxically combined the transformative moral judgment associated with human rights and the pragmatic avoidance of judgment associated with humanitarianism. Focusing on advocacy for humanitarian intervention and transitional justice, the paper examines how this amalgam of idealism and pragmatism undermines the critical role and defining aspirations of both movements. It concludes by considering how humanitarian and human rights organizations might provoke and assess political responses to injustice by clarifying the limits of their distinct claims to impartiality.\n      </p>", "The US is now the most important political force on the world scene calling for the establishment of transnational labour protections as a means of 'humanizing' the ongoing globalization of the capitalist economy. This paper raises critical questions about the US advocacy of transnational labour standards and norms by critically examining the existing system of US transnational labour protections. By means of a survey of different forms of transnational labour protections presently endorsed by the US, the paper argues that their internal legal weaknesses - in particular, their failure to institutionalize the minimal rudiments of modern formal legality - render them at best ineffective and at worst an instrument for attempts to assure the political and economic hegemony of the US, especially in those parts of the world in which the US has traditionally played a dominant role. Notwithstanding the understandable appeal of transnational labour standards, the US model of transnational labour protections represents a false humanitarianism which thus far has born few fruits for labour either in the US or abroad.\n      </p>", "Some have suggested that neutral humanitarianism is dead in the aftermath of the Cold War and 9/11. This article challenges the critical view called neo-humanitarianism and suggests that organizations such as the ICRC can carefully carve out an image of relative neutrality.

Various examples from history, including the Italian-Ethiopian War, World War II, and the Korean War, suggest the various complexities associated with neutrality.

The authors propose to cover both the transnational and the local as they search key texts in these sites for the terms for refugee status, humanitarianism, community and citizenship, and try to apprehend the shifts of meaning and movements of de-territorialization and re-territorialization. Our findings enable us to accomplish the deconstruction of these terms as well as their localization in the core of each one of these sites. The vision of humanitarian action which emerges from our analysis is one which puts its universality in question at the same time that it stimulates us to develop our perspective on localized concepts and their various significations, including those which emanate from transnational organizations.\n      </p>", "This article reports on the Warwick Conference on Humanitarianism, where practitioners and academics shared their experiences of the problems and limitations of humanitarianism, and how they dealt with them.

The first section examines the views of two leading thinkers who reject the statist paradigm, Bhikhu Parekh and Michael Walzer. Focusing on Parekh's and Walzer's conception of the state as a moral agent, and their conviction that states should engage in humanitarian intervention, the article argues that the problematic nature of the state as a moral agent is posed most starkly in relation to military humanitarian intervention. The theme of the second section is the critique of foundationalist claims to moral knowledge. Non-foundationalists emphasize the contingent nature of human solidarity, and this article focuses on the work of Richard Rorty. He is very critical of the claim that it is possible to construct a non-foundationalist universalism, and this controvery is increasingly prominent in the discipline of international relations. The final part of the article analyzes the attempt by Richard Falk and Ken Booth to construct a non-foundationalist defence of ethical universalism. By focusing on both foundationalist and non-foundationalist theories of human solidarity, the article attempts to provide insights into the question of how far different metatheoretical positions lead to different views of moral agency. /// Pourquoi les peuples nantis devraient-ils se soucier des souffrances des autres?

Despite renowned disagreements around the politics of sex and gender, these groups have come together to advocate for harsher penalties against traffickers, prostitutes\u2019 customers, and nations deemed to be taking insufficient steps to stem the flow of trafficked women. In this essay, I argue that what has served to unite this coalition of \u201cstrange bedfellows\u201d is not simply an underlying commitment to conservative ideals of sexuality, as previous commentators have offered, but an equally significant commitment to carceral paradigms of justice and to militarized humanitarianism as the preeminent mode of engagement by the state. I draw upon my ongoing ethnographic research with feminist and evangelical antitrafficking movement leaders to argue that the alliance that has been so efficacious in framing contemporary antitrafficking politics is the product of two historically unique and intersecting trends: a rightward shift on the part of many mainstream feminists and other secular liberals away from a redistributive model of justice and toward a politics of incarceration, coincident with a leftward sweep on the part of many younger evangelicals toward a globally oriented social justice theology. In the final section of this essay, I consider the resilience of these trends given a newly installed and more progressive Obama administration, positing that they are likely to continue even as the terrain of militarized humanitarian action shifts in accordance with new sets of geopolitical interests.\n      </p>", "The politics of life and death is explored from the perspective of Doctors Without Borders (M\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res [MSF]), an activist nongovernmental organization explicitly founded to respond to health crises on a global scale. Following the work of Michel Foucault and Giorgio Agamben, I underline key intersections between MSF's operations that express concern for human life in the midst of humanitarian disaster and the group's self-proclaimed ethic of engaged refusal. Adopting the analytic frame of biopolitics, I suggest that the actual practice of medical humanitarian organizations in crisis settings presents a fragmentary and uncertain form of such power, extended beyond stable sovereignty and deployed within a restricted temporal horizon.\n      </p>", "In practices of philanthropy and charity, the impulse to give to immediate others in distress is often tempered by its regulation. Although much of what is written on charity and philanthropy focuses on the effects of the gift, I suggest more attention be paid to the impulse of philanthropy. To coerce the impulse to give into rational accountability is to obliterate its freedom; to render giving into pure impulse is to reinforce social inequality. The only solution is to allow both to exist, and to create structures to encourage them. This essay examines the power of the spontaneous and fleeting impulse to give and its regulation through an analysis of contemporary practices of philanthropy and their relation to sacred conceptions of d\u0101n (donation) in New Delhi. When scriptural ideas of disinterested giving intersect with contemporary notions of social responsibility, new philanthropic practices are formed. On the basis of ethnographic research with philanthropists who built temples, started NGOs, and managed social welfare programs, as well as families who gave d\u0101n daily out of their homes, this essay documents how both NGO and government efforts to regulate one of the most meritorious forms of d\u0101n, gupt d\u0101n (or, anonymous d\u0101n) expresses critical issues in philanthropy between the urge to give in response to immediate suffering and the social obligation to find a worthy recipient for the gift.\n      </p>", "In this article, I examine the child sponsorship program of World Vision Zimbabwe-offering perspectives from nongovernmental organization (NGO) employees, sponsors, sponsored children, and rural communities being assisted. I demonstrate how transnational processes of giving and membership in a global Christian family contrast with Zimbabwean interpretations of humanitarian assistance and efforts to initiate a Zimbabwean child sponsorship program amidst growing local inequalities. In effect, new perceptions of economic disparity are produced by the very humanitarian efforts that strive to overcome them. I explore the intimate and personal relationships encouraged by sponsorship and the political economies within which they are situated, which include jealousies, desires, and altered senses of belonging.\n      </p>", "           ", "L'article d\u00e9fend l'opinion que le concept d'humanitarisme bas\u00e9 sur les droits de la personne n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 atteindre l'un des objectifs qu'il s'\u00e9tait fix\u00e9, \u00e0 savoir la transformation du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de l'aide qui, de victime passive devait se m\u00e9tamorphoser en citoyen dot\u00e9 de droits.

This is largely a result of the fact that a human rights approach relies upon the collection and representation of narratives of suffering in order to gain financing and political influence. In northern Uganda, where research for this article took place, people in the camps for displaced had come to understand the role of their suffering. They instrumentalized their tales in an attempt to connect with the wider world and to bring an end to the conflict and their deprivation. In a period where the quality and quantity of international connections and networks is critical for the development and political and social wellbeing of a society or nation, the nature of the relations developed between people is increasingly important. The failure to improve the position of recipients of aid vis-\u00e0-vis the wider international community is therefore of crucial significance and needs to be continually analysed and addressed.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "r />\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sociology.uchicago.edu/ajs/about.shtml\">Editorial Office Website</a>\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1290223406099/AJSrecform.pdf\">Library Recommendation Form</a>\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"/page/publisher/ucpress/adv.html\">Advertise in <i>AJS</i></a>\n<br />\n</p></p>\n\t\t\t", "r />\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sociology.uchicago.edu/ajs/about.shtml\">Editorial Office Website</a>\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1290223406099/AJSrecform.pdf\">Library Recommendation Form</a>\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"/page/publisher/ucpress/adv.html\">Advertise in <i>AJS</i></a>\n<br />\n</p></p>\n\t\t\t", "", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The agency, \"International Health Mission\" (IHM), primarily supplies medical technologies to Lutheran clinics in Madagascar, Tanzania, and Cameroon. I argue that popular material devices of relief provision, such as handmade bandages, tie the Christian humanitarian project to older notions of Lutheran faith as caregiving and pose special challenges to the bureaucratic model of aid delivery espoused by IHM. Casting renewed scholarly attention on materiality sheds light on the unique dilemmas facing faith-based aid agencies that strategically merge political discourses of humanitarianism with religious motivations for their work.\n      </p>", "Responding to the problem of unknowing in the contemporary pursuit of knowledge, my commentary on Wenzel Geissler's article extends its themes to a parallel, overlapping domain of humanitarianism. The provision of medical aid shares the preference of research trials for an egalitarian style and similarly avoids recognizing the very inequities that structure its relations. The humanitarian embrace of exception and moral discourse likewise parallels the manner in which research partnerships elide obligation, emphasizing responsibility in terms of ethical regulation. When actors share a stake in not knowing, it complicates the critical task, requiring something other than simple unveiling.\n      </p>"], "words": {"operations": {"number": 1}, "essay": {"number":

Citizens face the speaker's problem of how to make their presentations convincing, given the technical matters involved and the fact that Town Board members have likely already heard about these issues. Some speakers draw on the words of others in their presentations. Using another's words allows the speaker to cite an authoritative source or to respond to what another has said, to evaluate it, and often to challenge it. Speakers use other devices in addition to quotes, such as formulations, repetition, and membership categorizations to develop their evaluative stances in the reporting context. The study's focus is the discursive construction and rhetoric of using others' words for the speaker's own purposes.\n      </p>", "On May 26 and 27, 1994 several national newspapers reported the findings of Christie and Schultz (1994) who cannot reject the hypothesis that market makers of active NASDAQ stocks implicitly colluded to maintain spreads of at least $0.25 by avoiding odd-eighth quotes. On May 27, dealers in Amgen, Cisco Systems, and Microsoft sharply increased their use of odd-eighth quotes, and mean inside and effective spreads fell nearly 50 percent. This pattern was repeated for Apple Computer the following trading day. Using individual dealer quotes for Apple and Microsoft, we find that virtually all dealers moved in unison to adopt odd-eighth quotes.\n      </p>", "This paper compares the quality of quotes submitted by electronic communication networks (ECNs) and by traditional market makers to the Nasdaq quote montage. An analysis of the most active Nasdaq stocks shows that ECNs not only post informative quotes, but also, compared to market makers, ECNs post quotes rapidly and are more often at the inside. Additionally, ECN quoted spreads are smaller than dealer quoted spreads. The evidence suggests that the proliferation of alternative trading venues, such as ECNs, may promote quote quality rather than fragmenting markets. Moreover, the results suggest that a more open book contributes to quote quality.\n      </p>", "Endophasia, phenomenologically speaking, is speech without a signal. While its activity was at first noticed in pathology and in dreams as an effect of the intrusion of the unconscious, its everyday existence presents just as much of an enigma for linguistic analysis, which is used to approaching its sequences in scriptural form. Writing being founded on a conventional, and partial, correspondence between graphs and certain properties inherent in phonetic utterances, internal speech by contrast offers only a temporal dimension to acoustic apprehension. This temporal dimension operates on two levels: in the breakdown of phonemes and in their reduction via processes skin to anaphora: quotes. Thus it is on both phonological and semantic levels that endophasia provides the touchstone of theories of language.\n      </p>", "The NASDAQ multiple dealer market is designed to produce narrow bid-ask spreads through the competition for order flow among individual dealers. However, we find that odd-eighth quotes are virtually nonexistent for 70 of 100 actively traded NASDAQ securities, including Apple Computer and Lotus Development. The lack of odd-eighth quotes cannot be explained by the negotiation hypothesis of Harris (1991), trading activity, or other variables thought to impact spreads. This result implies that the inside spread for a large number of NASDAQ stocks is at least $0.25 and raises the question of whether NASDAQ dealers implicitly collude to maintain wide spreads.\n      </p>", "This paper presents an empirical microstructure model of bid and ask quotes that features discreteness, random costs of market making, and ARCH volatility effects.

Figures obtained from prior research are tentative due to methodological problems and the mismatch between reported expenditures and actual gambling revenue. Using improved methods for assessing the prevalence of problem gambling and the accuracy of self-reported gambling expenditures, the present study estimates that the 4.8 percent of problem gamblers in Ontario in 2003 accounted for approximately 36 percent of Ontario gambling revenue.

Measurable strategies have the advantage over arbitrary strategies in that they induce countably additive probability measures. In this work, we show that measurable strategies are adequate in order to maximize return if and only if the optimal return function is measurable.

The relevant contextual factor is the presence of a riskless lottery in a preference comparison. The theory only deviates from expected utility if the set of options contains both riskless and risky lotteries. The main motivation for the theory is to explain the gambling effect. Contrary to previous theories of the gambling effect, the present theory is consistent with stochastic dominance. It can, however, violate transitivity. The theory allows for a decomposition of the interaction between risk aversion and gambling aversion and thereby extends the classical Arrow-Pratt measure of risk aversion.\n      </p>", "Dynamic programming is used to solve some simple gambling models. In particular we consider the situation where an individual may bet any integral amount not greater than his fortune and he will win this amount with probability p or lose it with probability 1-p. It is shown that if p\u2265 1/2 then the timid strategy (always bet one dollar) both maximizes the probability of ever reaching any preassigned fortune, and also stochastically maximizes the time until the bettor becomes broke. Also, if $p&lt;{\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}}$ then the timid strategy while not stochastically maximizing the playing time does maximize the expected playing time. We also consider the same model but with the additional structure that the bettor need not gamble but may instead elect to work for some period of time. His goal is to minimize the expected time until his fortune reaches some preassigned goal. We show that if $p&lt;{\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}}$ then (i) always working is optimal, and (ii) among those strategies that only allow working when the bettor is broke it is the bold strategy that is optimal\n      </p>", "Dans cet article, nous analysons l'\u00e9tat actuel et l'avenir possible du jeu sur Internet au Canada.

We apply Howlet's (1998) refinement of Kingdon's \"policy windows\" theory to examine four windows of opportunity through which Internet gambling might be placed on the Canadian policy agenda. We conclude that Internet gambling is unlikely to reach the agenda through a routine means; instead, the issue might be recognized by policy-makers through alternative routes such as connection to another Internet-related issue or to a crisis that would intensify the political or economic problems related to the current murky status of online gambling.\n      </p>", "\"Oscar's system\" is a gambling system in which the aim is to win one betting unit, at least with high probability, and then start over again.

The survey utilised an adapted version of Aupperle's (1982) corporate social responsibility instrument to measure the priority given to economic, legal, ethical and discretionary principles in club machine gambling operations. The survey also assessed support for certain management practices in responsible gambling. The results indicate that the participating club managers prioritise economic, legal, ethical and discretionary principles respectively, and that these are statistically related to practices they have implemented and support in responsible gambling. The managers most favoured secondary harm minimisation practices, followed by reactive primary intervention. Less favoured were proactive primary intervention and discretionary practices. These principles and practices contrast markedly with those advocated by key stakeholder groups, as expressed in semi-structured interviews and submissions to the NSW Gaming Inquiry. Non-industry stakeholders favoured a more balanced set of principles and a more holistic set of management practices in responsible gambling.

If the utility function is further required to satisfy certain uniform integrability conditions, or if the gambling problem corresponds to an optimal stopping problem, the optimal return function is measurable.

Design: A Geographical Information Systems (GIS) measure of neighbourhood access to gambling venues. Two-level logistic regression models were fitted to examine the effects of neighbourhood access on individual gambling behaviour after controlling for potential individual- and neighbourhood-level confounding factors. Setting: 38 350 neighbourhoods across New Zealand. Participants: 12 529 respondents of the 2002/03 New Zealand Health Survey. Results: Compared with those living in the quartile of neighbourhoods with the furthest access to a gambling venue, residents living in the quartile of neighbourhoods with the closest access were more likely (adjusted for age, sex, socio-economic status at the individual-level and deprivation, urban/rural status at the neighbourhood-level) to be a gambler (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.15) or problem gambler (OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.03 to 7.05). When examined independently, neighbourhood access to venues with non-casino gaming machines (gambling: OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.18; problem gambling: OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.45 to 5.07) and sports betting venues (gambling: OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.18; problem gambling: OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.45 to 5.07) were similarly related.

A consequence of this regularity property is that the value of M(A)(x) is unchanged if, as in the gambling theory of Dubins and Savage, the player is allowed to use nonmeasurable strategies.

When such a scheme is used for investment in a stationary ergodic market with unknown distribution, the compounded capital will grow with the same limiting rate as could be achieved if the infinite past and hence of the distribution of the market were known to begin with. By specializing the market to a Kelly horse race, we obtain a universal scheme for gambling on a stationary ergodic process with values in a finite set. We point out the connection between universal gambling schemes and universal modeling schemes that are used in noiseless data compression. We also discuss a universal prediction scheme to learn, from past experience, the conditional distribution given the infinite past of the next outcome of a stationary ergodic process with values in a Polish space. This generalizes Ornstein's scheme for finite-valued processes.

A thesis is developed that in Native North America gambling was one common mechanism for intergroup exchange. Particular attention is paid to dice games that, according to ethnographic accounts, were often played primarily by women. Building upon the pioneering compilation by Stewart Culin, game paraphernalia, playing rules, as well as odds and payoffs associated with wagering are described and mapped. The social and mythological contexts of dice games are also reviewed. Results indicate that making hitherto neglected links among exchange, gender, and gambling promises novel and more culturally informed ways of approaching the archaeological record.\n      </p>", "In the classic Dubins\u2014Savage subfair primitive casino gambling problem, the gambler can stake any amount in his possession, winning (1 \u2014 r)/r times the stake with probability w and losing the stake with probability 1 \u2014 w, 0 \u2264 w \u2264 r \u2264 1. The gambler seeks to maximize the probability of reaching a fixed fortune (the goal) by gambling repeatedly with suitably chosen stakes.

This paper is concerned with a further extension of the Dubins\u2014Savage gambling problem involving time-dependent parameters, and shows that bold play not only maximizes the probability of reaching the goal, but also stochastically minimizes the number of plays needed to reach the goal. As a result, bold play also maximizes the expected utility, where the utility at the goal is only required to be monotone decreasing with respect to the number of plays needed to reach the goal. It is further noted that bold play remains optimal even when the time-dependent parameters are random.\n      </p>", "We investigate the ability of expected utility theory to account for simultaneous gambling and insurance. Contrary to a previous claim that borrowing and lending in perfect capital markets removes the demand for gambles, we show expected utility theory with nonconcave utility functions can explain gambling. When the rates of interest and time preference are equal, agents seek to gamble unless income falls in a finite set of values. When they differ, there is a range of incomes where gambles are desired. Different borrowing and lending rates can account for persistent gambling provided the rates span the rate of time preference.\n      </p>", "Gambling is a prevalent recreational behaviour. Approximately 5% of adults have been estimated to experience problems with gambling. The most severe form of gambling, pathological gambling (PG), is recognized as a mental health condition. Two alternate non-mutually exclusive conceptualizations of PG have considered it as an obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder and a 'behavioural' addiction. The most appropriate conceptualization of PG has important theoretical and practical implications. Data suggest a closer relationship between PG and substance use disorders than exists between PG and obsessive-compulsive disorder. This paper will review data on the neurobiology of PG, consider its conceptualization as a behavioural addiction, discuss impulsivity as an underlying construct, and present new brain imaging findings investigating the neural correlates of craving states in PG as compared to those in cocaine dependence.

Gambling markets are among the most restricted and politicized markets in the American economy, yet economists interested in the economics of regulation have paid them little attention. Applying the economic theory of regulation to gambling markets can lead to greater understanding of current public policy. In addition, this application may shed light on the discipline itself, as to its ability to explain recurrent fluctuations in the extent of regulatory intervention over long periods of time. Broadly speaking, the interest group model is consistent with changes in the extent of regulation, including the recent period of liberalization and consequent growth in gambling.\n      </p>", "In the classic Dubins\u2014Savage subfair primitive casino gambling problem, the gambler can stake any amount in his possession, winning (1 \u2014 r)/r times the stake with probability w and losing the stake with probability 1 \u2014 w, 0 \u2264 w \u2264 r \u2264 1.

Coiled baskets were used in a gambling game, played primarily by women, in which dice were tossed into a basket. Little information on these baskets has been published and collection information for museum specimens is typically very poor. Building on Weltfish's (1930a) initial study, this paper presents additional data on over 80 Plains gambling baskets presently housed in U.S. museums and private collections. Archaeological, ethnohistorical, and technical information, including data from this analysis, supports a southern origin for historic Plains coiled and perhaps plaited basketry. Diffusion of technological features of basketry construction out of areas in northern Mexico and Trans-Pecos Texas likely began as much as 3,000 years ago and progressed more rapidly during the last 400 years. It is suggested that the spread of historic Plains basketry is related to a northward spread of agriculture with Caddoan and Siouan language speakers. Eastern Shoshone gambling baskets are viewed as resulting from a separate local basketry tradition with origins in the eastern Great Basin.\n      </p>", "In a well-publicized analysis of visitor suicides in three casino areas (Atlantic City, Las Vegas, and Reno), elevated suicide risk among interstate visitors was attributed to the presence of legalized gambling.

It is also a behaviour that can become harmful, and potentially addictive, in a minority of individuals. This article considers the status of two dominant approaches to gambling behaviour. The cognitive approach has identified a number of erroneous beliefs held by gamblers, which cause them to over-estimate their chances of winning. The psychobiological approach has examined case-control differences between groups of pathological gamblers and healthy controls, and has identified dysregulation of brain areas linked to reward and emotion, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and striatum, as well as alterations in dopamine neurotransmission. In integrating these two approaches, recent data are discussed that reveal anomalous recruitment of the brain reward system (including the vmPFC and ventral striatum) during two common cognitive distortions in gambling games: the near-miss effect and the effect of personal control. In games of chance, near-misses and the presence of control have no objective influence on the likelihood of winning. These manipulations appear to harness a reward system that evolved to learn skill-oriented behaviours, and by modulating activity in this system, these cognitive distortions may promote continued, and potentially excessive, gambling.\n      </p>", "An analysis of the gambling process, a review of gambling research, and a survey of philosophical, phenomenological, and theoretical interpretations of gambling suggest that the motives for gambling are highly complex. However, many similarities were found between anecdotal accounts of gamblers' experiences and the philosophical, phenomenological, and theoretical interpretations of the gambling process. Many of the research studies corroborated both the anecdotal accounts and the interpretations. The most fruitful and veridical findings seem to come from studies that recognized gambling as adult play. The significance of studying gambling as play readily revealed itself, and it is hoped that future research expands on the existential and transpersonal nature of this aspect of gambling. We have come a long way in increasing our knowledge of gambling since Bergler's original interpretation of gambling as psychic masochism. Gambling may be psychic masochism for some, but it is without doubt psychic play pleasure for the vast majority of persons who gamble.\n      </p>", "To identify independent correlates of reported gambling problems amongst the Indigenous population of Australia. A cross-sectional design was applied to a nationally representative sample of the Indigenous population. Estimates of reported gambling problems are presented by remoteness and jurisdiction. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent correlates of reported gambling problems amongst individuals and their social and family networks. The analysis was stratified by remoteness. Indigenous people living in remote locations reported significantly more gambling problems than those living in non-remote locations. In non-remote areas, being female, having high personal income, being more socially connected (i.e. involved in an Indigenous organisation or living in a household where all members were Indigenous) and reporting community problems were associated with higher levels of reported gambling problems. In remote areas, multifamily households, participation in sports and cultural events, and reporting of community problems were associated with higher reported gambling problems, while having a relative removed from their natural family was associated with lower reported problems. Problematic gambling is clearly related to the social and environmental contexts in which it occurs. Harm minimisation policies that focus on a reduction in crowding (especially in remote locations), increased public awareness of the negative consequences of gambling, improving access to support services, and lifting the socioeconomic status of Indigenous people may reduce gambling related harm in the medium to long term.\n      </p>", "With the rapid expansion of gambling have also come concerns about underage gambling and youth problem gambling. Most studies of youth gambling have found that the majority of youths have gambled but do so infrequently and do not suffer any adverse consequences. A minority of youths, however, appear to be over-involved in gambling and are experiencing problems associated with their gambling. This is the first generation of youths to be exposed to such widespread access to gambling venues, ubiquitous gambling advertising, and general social approval of gambling. Gambling is the only so-called vice endorsed and promoted in many locales by both the church and state. On the one hand, youths are instructed by their teachers (and ostensibly their state department of education) that the way to get ahead in life is to study and work hard; on the other hand, their state lottery tells them that they need only to be lucky. Youths are adept at recognizing these apparent discrepancies and may be confused by this mixed message. Future research will need to address a number of gaps in our knowledge about youth gambling.\n      </p>", "The study of gambling behavior or of the impact of gambling on social institutions does not have a significant tradition in sociology. There have been a few attempts to test propositions associated with functionalism, alienation, anomie, and decision making; however, the results of these studies have proven inconclusive. Despite the fact that a large proportion of any society participates in gambling and that gambling is continuing to affect public policy in many jurisdictions, sociologists have not treated gambling as behavior worthy of serious investigation. This article reviews (1) the application of various sociological theories to gambling behavior; and (2) the results of the limited number of research efforts prompted by these perspectives.\n      </p>", "We show that prospect theory offers a rich theory of casino gambling, one that captures several features of actual gambling behavior. First, we demonstrate that for a wide range of preference parameter values, a prospect theory agent would be willing to gamble in a casino even if the casino offers only bets with no skewness and with zero or negative expected value. Second, we show that the probability weighting embedded in prospect theory leads to a plausible time inconsistency: at the moment he enters a casino, the agent plans to follow one particular gambling strategy; but after he starts playing, he wants to switch to a different strategy. The model therefore predicts heterogeneity in gambling behavior: how a gambler behaves depends on whether he is aware of the time inconsistency; and, if he is aware of it, on whether he can commit in advance to his initial plan of action.\n      </p>", "Opportunities for legal gambling of various types have expanded rapidly in the United States in recent years. Our study develops a series of theoretical arguments linking multiple dimensions of religious involvement\u2014 traditions, beliefs, practices, and networks \u2014 with the frequency of gambling activity. Relevant hypotheses are then tested using data from the Panel Study of American Religion and Ethnicity (PS-ARE), a recent nationwide probability sample of U. S. adults. Findings underscore the importance of co-religionist networks in deterring gambling. In addition, biblical inerrantists and members of conservative Protestant and sectarian groups are relatively disinclined to gamble. Religious attendance is also inversely associated with gambling frequency. Differences in gambling by religious tradition are amplified among persons with strong co-religionist networks. Several study limitations are noted, and promising future research directions on the dynamics and functioning of church-based networks are identified.\n      </p>", "The objective of this study is to evaluate the informational efficiency of the market for betting on horse races. Whereas the price data used in previous studies have been drawn largely from totalizator (parimutuel) odds, the data used in this study are derived from bookmaker odds. The availability of a series of prices throughout betting facilitates the use of filter tests to evaluate market efficiency. We conclude that this gambling market is efficient in the use of information supplied via both the movements in odds during the course of betting and the selections of newspaper tipsters. However, there is evidence to suggest that those with access to private information can earn positive returns from gambling.\n      </p>", "Some form of commercial gambling is legal in almost every state of the Union, reflecting substantial consumer demand for these activities. Yet gambling is regarded by policymakers, the media, and the public as an industry that is different and not subject to the economic laws that govern other industries. However, by examining gambling through standard measures such as consumer spending expressed as percentages of personal income, job creation, and gambling privilege tax receipts, it can be determined that gambling industries are not operating independently of the larger economic context. One of the fastest-growing sectors of the general economy, gambling accounts for about 10 percent of leisure expenditures.\n      </p>", "In all the criticisms that have shadowed the financial industry in recent years, the burden seems to be, that the reckless (as opposed to malicious) bankers too often took money of which they were the appointed stewards, and used it for speculation, especially in junk bonds. As Shaheen Borna and James Lowry argue in their \"Gambling and Speculation\" (the only article on gambling that I was able to raise on my computer) business speculation is probably wrong, since it is very like gambling, which everyone knows is wrong. But why is gambling wrong? If we, as the ethicists of business, are to adopt an uncharacteristically judgmental posture toward the most venerable American institutions, occupying the tallest and closest of American buildings, by calling their residents \"gamblers,\" then surely we ought to be able to provide an account of the blameworthiness of gambling itself. That, at any rate, is the challenge I set myself for this paper.\n      </p>", "We introduce Parrondo's paradox that involves games of chance. We consider two fair gambling games, A and B, both of which can be made to have a losing expectation by changing a biasing parameter \u03b5. When the two games are played in any alternating order, a winning expectation is produced, even though A and B are now losing games when played individually. This strikingly counter-intuitive result is a consequence of discrete-time Markov chains and we develop a heuristic explanation of the phenomenon in terms of a Brownian ratchet model. As well as having possible applications in electronic signal processing, we suggest important applications in a wide range of physical processes, biological models, genetic models and sociological models. Its impact on stock market models is also an interesting open question.\n      </p>", "Widespread resentment against gambling may be explained by the failure of gamblers to perform normally expected productive functions. The degree of antipathy differs according to clas. The chance element in human life is particularly exploited in those societies where status is largely competitive and dependent upon pecuniary standards. The stabilizing and routinized mechanisms of social living are antithetical to gambling, which resists arbitrary social control.\n      </p>", "Although legalized gambling, and in particular casino gambling, has become an increasingly important American leisure activity, it has not escaped extensive controversy. Among the many evils forecast for communities that open casinos is a major increase in street crime. This article will review what we know about the relationship between street crime and casino gambling.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img

This approach should address the most important and challenging consumer decisions, describe consumer behavior in a manner that leads to prescriptions, consider the actions of other parties in the marketplace, and identify biases unique to or exacerbated by the consumer context.

Ownership of process patents for on-line brokerage activities is positively correlated with differentiation advantage.

McMahon and Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., the U.S. Supreme Court in effect mandated that disputes in the securities industry that are the subject of predispute arbitration agreements be resolved by arbitration panels rather than by the courts. At the time these two decisions were issued, most knowledgeable people shared the belief that the securities industry had worked diligently to achieve this result and looked forward to the protections and benefits that the new litigation forum would provide. Indeed, it was widely accepted that the businesspeople, lawyers, and securities industry representatives who comprise the majority oi the pools from which arbitrators are drawn would be conservative in their decisions and, in general, would favor the industry's positions. There was also widespread concern that these securities arbitration panels might begin to erode or effectively limit certain legal positions in favor of public investors adopted by the courts. Interestingly, these anticipated results did not come to pass. Indeed, after fourteen years of experience with securities arbitrations, it is possible to reach certain tentative conclusions that are not at all consistent with the anticipated results. In a number of important areas, instead of favoring defendant brokerage firms and their personnel, securities arbitration panels appear to have stretched or reached beyond existing legal authorities in order to expand the rights and the protections accorded to members of the investing public.\n      </p>", "This Article describes a variety of factors that encourage both command and control regulation and regulatory incrementalism.

In these circumstances, more on-line broker-dealers have conducted compliance reviews of their supervisory procedures and on-line trading systems to take into account new rules and other guidance provided by securities regulators. This Article examines issues broker-dealers should consider in developing and reviewing supervisory procedures and controls for market conduct and sales practices in an on-line environment.\n      </p>", "From 1997 to March 2000, as technology stocks rose more than five-fold, institutions bought more new technology supply than individuals. Among institutions, hedge funds were the most aggressive investors, but independent investment advisors and mutual funds (net of flows) actively invested the most capital in the technology sector. The technology stock reversal in March 2000 was accompanied by a broad sell-off from institutional investors but accelerated buying by individuals, particularly discount brokerage clients. Overall, our evidence supports the bubble model of Abreu and Brunnermeier (2003), in which rational arbitrageurs fail to trade against bubbles until a coordinated selling effort occurs.\n      </p>", "Hedge funds have become critical players in both corporate governance and corporate control. In this Article, Professors Kahan and Rock document and examine the nature of hedge fund activism, how and why it differs from activism by traditional institutional investors, and its implications for corporate governance and regulatory reform. The authors argue that hedge fund activism differs from activism by traditional institutions in several ways: it is directed at significant changes in individual companies (rather than small, systemic changes), it entails higher costs, and it is strategic and ex ante (rather than incidental and ex post). The reasons for these differences may lie in the incentive structures of hedge fund managers as well as in the fact that traditional institutions face regulatory barriers, political constraints, or conflicts of interest that make activism less profitable than it is for hedge funds. But the differences may also be due to the fact that traditional institutions pursue a diversification strategy that is difficult to combine with strategic activism. Although hedge funds hold great promise as active shareholders, their intense involvement in corporate governance and control raises two potential problems: the interests of hedge funds sometimes diverge from those of their fellow shareholders, and the intensity of hedge fund activism imposes substantial stress that the regulatory system may not be able to withstand. The resulting concerns, however, are relatively isolated and narrow, do not undermine the value of hedge fund activism as a whole, and do not warrant major additional regulatory interventions. The sharpest accusation leveled against activist funds is that activism is designed to achieve a short-term payoff at the expense of long-term profitability. Although the authors consider this a potentially serious problem that arguably pervades hedge fund activism, they conclude that a sufficient case for legal intervention has not been made. This conclusion results from the uncertainties about whether short-termism is, in fact, a real problem and how much hedge fund activism is driven by excessive short-termism. But most importantly, it stems from the authors' view that market forces and adaptive devices adopted by companies individually are better designed than regulation to deal with the potential negative effects of hedge fund short-termism, while preserving the positive effects of hedge-fund activism.\n      </p>", "Institutions often have access to corporate inside information through their connections, but relatively little is known about the extent to which they exploit their informational advantage through short-term trading. We employ broker-level trading data to systematically examine possible cases of connected trading. Despite examining the issue from multiple angles, we are unable to find much evidence to support that investment bank clients take advantage of connections through takeover advising, IPO and SEO underwriting, or lending relationships. In contrast to recent academic literature and popular press, our findings suggest that institutional investors are reluctant to use inside information in traceable manners.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>"], "words": {"help": {"number": 1}, "ith": {"number": 3}, "through": {"number": 2}, "questions": {"number": 1}, "decisions": {"number": 1}, "industries": {"number": 1}, "buyers": {"number": 1}, "connections,": {"number": 1}, "to": {"number": 3}, "finance": {"number": 1}, "advantage": {"number": 1}, "they": {"number": 1}, "hedge": {"number": 1}, "outlines": {"number": 1}, "common": {"number": 1}, "become": {"number": 1}, "often": {"number": 1}, "incrementalism": {"number": 1}, "our": {"number": 1}, "for": {"number": 1}, "factors": {"number": 1}, "profitability": {"number": 1}, "emotions": {"number": 1}, "research": {"number": 1}, "access": {"number": 1}, "may": {"number": 1}, "encourage": {"number": 1}, "critical": {"number": 1}, "across": {"number": 1}, "shows": {"number": 1}, "we": {"number": 1}, "business": {"number": 1}, "broker": {"number": 1}, "extent": {"number": 1}, "regulatory": {"number": 1}, "lottery": {"number": 1}, "teach": {"number": 1}, "both": {"number": 2}, "about": {"number": 2}, "of": {"number": 7}, "players": {"number": 1}, "control": {"number": 2}, "exploit": {"number": 1}, "article": {"number": 2}, "little": {"number": 1}, "from": {"number": 1}, "thoughts,": {"number": 1}, "distinct": {"number": 1}, "two": {"number": 2}, "governance": {"number": 1}, "their": {"number": 2}, "regulation": {"number": 1}, "describes": {"number": 1}, "lowest": {"number": 1}, "that": {"number": 2}, "funds": {"number": 1}, "but": {"number": 1}, "known": {"number": 1}, "this": {"number": 2}, "inside": {"number": 1}, "us": {"number": 1}, "can": {"number": 1}, "behavior": {"number": 1}, "many": {"number": 1}, "informational": {"number": 1}, "and": {"number": 6}, "is": {"number": 1}, "sample": {"number": 1}, "examine": {"number": 1}, "have": {"number": 2}, "in": {"number": 4}, "aspirations,": {"number": 1}, "relatively": {"number": 1}, "information": {"number": 1}, "variety": {"number": 2}, "traders": {"number": 1}, "which": {"number": 1}, "answer": {"number": 1}, "u": {"number": 1}, "stock": {"number": 1}, "used": {"number": 1}, "models": {"number": 1}, "a": {"number": 4}, "short": {"number": 1}, "methodologies": {"number": 1}, "consumer": {"number": 1}, "command": {"number": 1}, "landmark": {"number": 1}, "the": {"number": 4}, "settimeout": {"number": 1}, "corporate": {"number": 3}, "institutions": {"number": 1}}}, "Counterculture": {"total_words": 186, "documents": ["In the 1950s, exotica was a genre of pop music that specialized in depicting imaginary exotic paradises and conventionalized natives. By the late 1960s, exotica pop had disappeared, but its tropes of temporal and spatial disjuncture persisted, structuring the music, visual art, and social theory of the utopian counterculture. While 1950s and 1960s kinds of exotica differ in their preferred imaginary destinations, both raise the question of what intermediate shades between belief and disbelief are demanded by aestheticized representations of human life. This essay theorizes exotica as a mode of representation governed by a peculiar mode of reception\u2014one of willed credulity enabled by submission to its spectacle. What exotica demands is what intellectuals are least likely to give, though, and the peculiar pleasures of exotica spectacle are denigrated or rendered invisible in the hermeneutic regime.\n      </p>", "Conventional and counterculture families are discussed as ideal types in eight activity areas ranging from childrearing and economics to religious and leisure time use.

The author challenges a view commonly held by Western commentators and scholars that Wang Shuo is a writer of \"common man\" fiction by highlighting the aristocratic background of his Cultural Revolution-era hooligan characters. In the post-Mao era, these former aristocratic youth hooligans tried to adapt to the new environment of growing commercialism and materialism. Some successfully joined the new elite through legal or illegal means, while those who failed to do so became marginalized and even impoverished. The author argues that it was the latter who felt the need to develop to perfection the skill of fast talk and an irreverent, knowing, and playful attitude, which helped them to maintain a sense of superiority. Glorified by Wang Shuo in his stories and commentary, the hooligan characters captured the imagination of many Chinese, especially the younger generations who feel marginalized and alienated, by legitimizing their desires and frustrations and by subverting the dominant ideology and culture.\n      </p>", "The primary purpose of this study was to compare and contrast an organization's official culture and its subcultures. The proposition that soft bureaucracies project a rigid exterior appearance, symbolizing what key stakeholders expect, while masking a loosely-coupled set of interior practices, guided this analysis of a police organization. The official culture (crime-fighting command bureaucracy) was examined as an arbitrary set of symbols and meaning structures arranged according to top management preferences. Using qualitative and quantitative data, the organization's subcultures were profiled. It was demonstrated that top management was unable to impose organization-wide conformance with the official culture. There was close conformance to the official culture in only one of five distinct clusters of officers (\"crime-fighting commandoes,\" 21 percent of the sample). Officers in the other clusters (\"crime-fighting street professionals,\" \"peace-keeping moral entrepreneurs,\" \"ass-covering legalists,\" and \"anti-military social workers\") substantially modified or rejected top management's dictates. They represented resistance subcultures, similar in their opposition to official culture, but unique in form. It was concluded that other organizations, not known for their monolithic image and solidarity, also encompass subcultures.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the mechanism of charismatic authority and the nature of religious life as advocated by two genres of charismatic religion: Hasidism and The Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity. Both the Jewish and Neo-Christian examples achieved prominence in the counterculture during the seventies. The paper argues that: (1) Weber's notions of the inherent precariousness of charismatic leadership and its requirement for empirical verification need modification; (2) charismatic authority appears more intimately related to a fixed norm than Weber suggested; (3) the twin processes of infantilization (the overconcretizing of a symbol) and scientism (truth comes only from the scientific method) have resulted in an apparent confusion of divine and human roles; and (4) the lack of clarity concerning transcendence as a referent has yielded a vulgarized form of homo religious.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The Bread and Puppet's \"Domestic Resurrection Circus\" emerged within the counterculture of the 1960s and '70s and continued through 1998.

Socio-historical models are generalizations which emphasize the repetitive side of history; developmental theories describe and explain particular historical phenomena. The model of the charismatic community of ideological virtuosi comprises an emotional consociation with a distinct pattern of ideology, membership and want satisfaction. Historically, the charisma of reason and natural rights, which infused its principles into the French Revolution and later into ethical socialism, was destroyed by the advent of evolutionary and deterministic Marxism. The recent youth and student rebellions are viewed as the charismatic eruption of a new moral mood reviving the charisma of reason, and the contemporary peaceful communes and warlike groups are interpreted as the counterculture's charismatic core.\n      </p>", "The presumed attractiveness of countercultural orientations to young, educated, baby boomers led many scholars to proclaim the 1960s counterculture as the driving force behind declining religious participation, and a supposed growing distaste for biblical religion. In contrast, theories of religious behavior predict substantial continuity in religious orientations and commitments. Social ties and life course events influence religious beliefs and rates of participation, yet these ties and transitions often support traditional religious expressions. I integrate insights from studies of baby boomer religion with more general theories of religious commitment, merging theories of the dual nature of social structures with rational choice perspectives on religious behavior. Using data from the 1965-1982 Youth Parent Socialization Panel Study, I analyze the relative influence of three factors on baby boomers' religious orientations and participation: (1) traditional agents of socialization (denominations, parents, and schools); (2) life course factors (marriage, divorce, and childrearing); and, (3) participation in the protest movements of the 1960s and early 1970s - a widely cited countercultural protagonist of religious change. I also demonstrate how prior religious orientations directed participation in the counterculture. My analyses show that traditional socialization agents, life course factors, and countercultural participation all play a role in directing future religious orientations and commitments. However, traditional socialization factors have a dominant influence on future religious beliefs and participation.\n      </p>", "\"Cowboys\" and \"Hippies\" are not as different as one might think.

A similar analysis of the underground press in the same countries during 1967-69 and 1970-72 revealed a marked shift from expressive priorities during the earlier period to political priorities during the later period.

This article reframes the protest through the lens of movement culture and analyzes the ties between different social movements. Activists at Columbia were a motley coalition of Harlemites and students, political and cultural radicals, black and white. This article argues that the establishment of five communes in occupied campus buildings facilitated the temporary reconciliation of political and social difference that accounts for the formation of the Columbia coalition. The tight confines within each commune sparked intense political and cultural debate but also forced activists to recognize the legitimacy of other views in the name of commune solidarity. The creation of multiple communes, however, allowed for several protest factions-including a black separatist group-to coexist under a single banner. The Columbia coalition provided a fleeting moment of unity during a period characterized by black separatism, white student radicalization, and counterculture flight to rural communes.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Early in the morning of May 12,1971, workmen armed with chainsaws arrived at the Kungstradgarden, a park in central Stockholm, to remove a group of elm trees on the site of a planned subway entrance and shopping mall. The timing was chosen to outmanuever protesters, who for several weeks had camped on the site in a final attempt to stop the trees being felled. However, on the night in question, thousands of people quickly gathered and the protest turned violent. In the history of modern Swedish planning, the \"Almstriden\" (The elm war) can be seen as a turning point. The action of saving a group of symbolically significant trees came to mark an end of the general support for modernization that had marked Swedish culture since 1930 during the years of socialist government, and also marked an end to the nation's trust in the welfare state's planning system under socialist government.
