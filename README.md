<b><h2>A topic classifier</h2></b><br><br><br>

<b>Approach:</b><br>
  - mined 337 topics
  - for each topic, mined 100 documents
  - cataloged each document counting words
  - kept a running total of all words
  - kept an individual log of per/document words
  - calculated probabilities in a Markov fasion
  
<b>Current Results:</b><br>
  - currently running tests (ostensibly working)



<b>Usage:</b><br>
  - the main use case for this would be someone looking to disambiguate text in a large computational fashion
  - ideally, this module will server as a hook for larger scale purposes
